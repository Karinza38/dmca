**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

It seems they weren't actually taken down, but we received a DMCA notice:  
[private]  

For these two files:  
* https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr-versions/blob/22e9c58e457fe602a2c4035812c9243e6eeff778/Ncr%20corporation/Privacy%20Policy.md  
* https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr-versions/blob/05a1131a01bd745b16fd556889b166ba35c01034/Ncr%20corporation/Legal%20Information.md

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

As you can read in [private], the allegation is "public exposure of unauthorized data", but that doesn't seem applicable to the documents in question, since they have always been public, and accessible to the general public without any form of authorization, authentication, or access control:  
* https://www.ncrvoyix.com/company/privacy-policy  
* https://www.ncrvoyix.com/company/legal-notice

We are merely hosting a mirror copy of snapshots of these two documents. Similar public snapshots of the same documents could already be found in other places, for instance at the Internet Archive:  
* [private]  
* [private]

We are using these public snapshots as part of our charitable activities as a non-profit project.  
Therefore, we believe the complaint doesn't account for the fact that our use is protected by the fair-use doctrine.

Nothing in this counter notice constitutes any admittance that the material in question is covered by copyright law, or that the activity of ToS;DR volunteers is subject to US law or jurisdiction. We are filing this counter notice on a without prejudice basis and reserve all rights.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
