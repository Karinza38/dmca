[private] and kept the program private; someone illegally obtained the files and uploaded them to GitHub without my permission. [private] the [private] and [private] [private] for the program and was the only one authorized to redistribute and sell the program. I contacted the repository owner to get them to remove it, but they declined and called me scummy for selling the program [private] [private] and [private] on [private]. I wish for the repository to be removed so that my copyrighted work is not infringed or leaked to other unauthorized users.

Everything in the original repository was stolen; the files were combined into a scanning program for Minecraft to scan players in worlds you join. [private] charging for the program and keeping it private. The leaked repository is a leaked version of the program that was redistributed without [private] permission.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

In the original version of the program [private] had two forms of authentication that were removed in this leaked repository. The first form of authentication was a whitelist check for valid users that required a password to log in and access the program. The second form of authentication was a logging check for whether users logged into the program. If the user logs in from an unusual location, it will flag them and temporarily restrict access. In the linked GitHub repository, both of these forms of authentication were removed, which allowed the program to be shared without the original developer's consent.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Since the project files aren't compiled and are instead plain text javascript and other assorted file types, the code involving the technological protection was able to be removed before being uploaded to the offending repository. The files could then be shared without the proper authentication without the developer's permission as it no longer checks for valid users or unusual user logins.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks of the offending repository; the account used was created at the time of the upload (12/19/2024), and the repository was created and archived the same day.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
