**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Provision or use of our services to anyone other than those who have contracted with our services is prohibited. Unless you sign a contract with our service, we do not provide related libraries (modules) and service implementation sources. Additionally, even if you have signed a contract with our service, it is illegal to post content related to our work without permission in an open space such as GITHUB, so we may be held legally responsible.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The current defendant project is designed to use our copyrighted files and sources without taking them down from the posts even though the contract with us has been terminated. It is presumed that a third party other than the current contracting party posted the posts without permission. Mobile Authentication Co., Ltd. may be held legally responsible for this.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, but we will continue to look for repositories that post our work without permission.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
