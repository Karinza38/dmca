**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the code in question, which [private] created and published in [private] GitHub repository https://github.com/D-ENCODER/KONGKNITEC in 2022.

The infringing repository contains direct copies of [private] original work but fails to comply with the terms of the MIT License under which [private] work is published. The MIT License requires proper attribution to the original author, including acknowledgment in the source code and documentation. The infringing repository neither provides attribution to [private] as the original author nor includes the required MIT License text, thereby violating the terms of the license.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a software project hosted in [private] GitHub repository at the following URL:
https://github.com/D-ENCODER/KONGKNITEC

This project, titled “KONGKNITEC”, was created and published by [private] in 2022. It consists of source code files, including but not limited to:

Main.py : This file is the entry point of [private] project.
dataset_sqlite_services.py: this file contains the database logic(the whole logic is copied)
and I believe the whole project is copied from [private] original repositories and no forking or credits are given to [private].

These files, as well as the overall structure and design of the repository, are original works created solely by [private]. The repository includes [private] original code, documentation, and other intellectual property.

The project is licensed under the MIT License, which permits reuse with proper attribution. However, the infringing repository does not provide such attribution and has directly copied [private] work without permission.

If needed, I can provide additional details, including commit history or specific code snippets, to substantiate [private] claim.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Maulikatgit/Kongknitec

The entire repository violates MIT License.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/Maulikatgit/Kongknitec

This repository only caught my Eye.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT License

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The license is being violated because the infringing repository fails to comply with the terms of the MIT License. Specifically:

1. Lack of Attribution: The repository does not provide proper attribution to [private] as the original author of the work. This includes omitting [private] name and failing to acknowledge the original repository (https://github.com/D-ENCODER/KONGKNITEC).
2. Missing License File: The repository does not include a copy of the MIT License, which is a mandatory requirement under the license terms.
3. Unauthorized Use: By reproducing [private] code and documentation without meeting these conditions, the repository is in violation of the MIT License.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To resolve this issue, the infringing repository must provide proper attribution in the README file and within the source code where applicable, as well as include the full text of the MIT License. Failure to address these issues promptly and fully should result in the takedown of the entire repository to prevent further violation of the license terms.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

To resolve the infringement, the infringing repository must:

1. Provide proper attribution to [private] as the original author of the work, including acknowledgment in the README file and relevant source code headers.
2. Include a copy of the MIT License in their repository, as required by the license terms.

Alternatively, if these requirements cannot be met, the infringing repository should be taken down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
