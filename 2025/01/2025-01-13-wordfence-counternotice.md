I believe the material was removed due to a misunderstanding of the GPLv3 license under which Wordfence is distributed. The GPLv3 permits the redistribution and modification of the software, provided that the same license terms are maintained. [private] repository complied with these terms, and I did not include any proprietary components or violate any terms of the license. Therefore, the takedown was a result of misidentification.
