Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 109 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The copyright for the Chatwoot software repository, located at https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot, is owned by [private]. The software includes proprietary code and features that are protected under copyright law and distributed under an Enterprise License that governs the usage of specific features requiring proper authorization.

In my capacity as [private], I have the authority to act on behalf of Chatwoot to enforce our copyrights, including addressing unauthorized use, modification, or distribution of our copyrighted material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is the Chatwoot software repository, which is located at https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot. Chatwoot is an open-source customer engagement platform that includes features such as live chat, email, and social media integrations.

While the core of Chatwoot is released under an open-source license, certain advanced features are governed by an Enterprise License, which restricts their use to users who have obtained appropriate licensing. These features include functionalities that are critical for enterprise-level deployments, such as advanced reporting, custom roles and permissions, and other enhanced configuration options.

The repository contains proprietary code protected by copyright law, and the Enterprise License terms explicitly prohibit unauthorized access, modification, or distribution of these features without proper licensing.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository located at https://github.com/sendingtk/chatwoot should be taken down, as it contains unauthorized modifications on the code and discussion that help bypass the Enterprise License restrictions and make proprietary features freely accessible without proper authorization.

Specific evidence of the infringement includes commits like [private], which explicitly states “unblock enterprise features,” clearly violating the licensing terms. Additionally, discussions in [private] show how the repository’s contributors are actively providing hacks and workarounds to bypass license checks with the Chatwoot server, enabling unauthorized use of enterprise-level features.

Given the representative number of forks reviewed, I have observed that all or most of the forks inherit the same infringing modifications as the parent repository. These forks perpetuate the violation by distributing the same unauthorized changes, further infringing upon the rights of Chatwoot’s copyrighted material. Therefore, I request the removal of the repository and all of its forks to prevent further violations.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Chatwoot implements measures to control access to copyrighted content, particularly the enterprise-level features governed by our Enterprise License. These measures include license validation checks that ensure enterprise features are only accessible to users who have obtained proper licensing. The license validation system communicates with our servers to verify authorization before granting access to these features.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project at https://github.com/sendingtk/chatwoot is designed to circumvent our technological protection measures by bypassing the license validation checks that restrict access to enterprise features. These measures ensure that enterprise-level functionalities are available only to licensed users.

Examples of this circumvention include, but are not limited to:

Code Modifications: A commit titled “unblock enterprise features” ([private]) alters the code to bypass license checks, enabling unauthorized use of restricted features.

Promoting Circumvention: Discussions such as [private] provide instructions for bypassing our server-based license verification, encouraging users to hack the system.

These are just some of many examples demonstrating deliberate efforts to override the protections we have in place to enforce our Enterprise License.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Based on a review of a representative number of forks, it is evident that the majority, if not all, inherit the same infringing modifications as the parent repository. These forks continue to propagate the violation by distributing the unauthorized changes, further infringing upon Chatwoot’s copyrighted material.

Given this, I formally request the removal of the original repository along with all its forks to prevent further copyright violations.

At the time of writing, there are over 100 forks, most of which were created within the past four months. Additionally, the infringing commit, introduced approximately eight months ago, is present in the majority of these forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, we don't have the contact information of the repository owner.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
