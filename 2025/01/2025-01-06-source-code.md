**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is proprietary source code belonging to our company's service.  
The repository at https://github.com/kushi19944 contains code that was published  
by a former employee of CAAD (our group company *1) who left the organization.

This code was inappropriately made public and has remained accessible even after the employee's
departure. Despite our attempts to contact the former employee regarding this matter, we have
received no response.
