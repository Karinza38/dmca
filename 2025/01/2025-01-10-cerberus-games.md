**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am employed by Cerberus Games LTD, legal owner of the videogame "Carnal Instinct", and empowered to act on behalf of the organisation. Cerberus Games holds the exclusive rights to Carnal Instinct.

Please note that prior to completion of this form I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Carnal Instinct is an 18+ RPG available via [private] and [private]. There is no free version of the game. Players can subscribe to the [private] for more frequent updates on a paid basis. Access to this subscription build is via the game launcher. More information on the game itself is available at https://carnal-instinct.com/

Both the launcher and the game itself are infringed by this content.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/OpenYiffGames/CarnalInstinctLauncher

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our launcher interfaces with the [private] API to login and validate the subscription status of a user, unlocking access to purchased content. The launcher confirms the tier at which the user is subscribed and only then downloads the build they paid for from our server. Only currently valid [private] subscriptions are able to download the game client. The launcher differentiates between different subscriptions and provides different builds based upon their tier.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

In the words of its creator; "This launcher downloads the official game launcher from public sources (Official servers) and then applies a patch on the fly to bypass the paywall system".

The stated purpose of the project is to bypass the protection and access the game for free.

The project has no application outside of spoofing a valid Patreon subscription within the launcher and enabling it to unlawfully download paid content directly from our servers via the compromised client.

There is clearly no fair use and the content violates the 1201 provision of the DMCA by bypassing, removal, deactivation, or impairment of our technological measures used for validating active subscriptions.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There do not appear to be any forks to https://github.com/OpenYiffGames/CarnalInstinctLauncher

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
