I am the [private] and [private] for the project being infringed upon.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is our second notice, as we've missed a couple of repositories on the first one.

The repositories contain reuploads of Pizza Tower: Cheesed Up's original source code, as well as web ports utilizing it ([invalid]). The project is a mod for Pizza Tower (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/).

The source code for the project was leaked without our permission. The infringing repositories are hosting said source, containing all of the code, music and assets made for the mod, which our team holds the copyright to. Additionally, since our project is a mod for an existing game, the repositories are also infringing on Tour de Pizza's copyright, as it's hosting pirated versions of Pizza Tower.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
