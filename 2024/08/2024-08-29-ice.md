Hi Github,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The documents at the following URLs contain documents that are proprietary and therefore infringing to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE):

https://github.com/haifeng-zheng/Open-Market-Initiative-Directory/tree/main/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/hctang2000/Directory/tree/master/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/ssh352/Directory/tree/master/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/loobins/Directory/tree/main/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/gsouza-mbochip/Directory/tree/main/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/khaleel737/Directory/tree/main/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/pxscott/Directory/tree/main/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/discrete-void/Directory/tree/main/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/valmac/Directory/tree/master/Specifications/Ice  
https://github.com/ywong587/Directory/tree/master/Specifications/Ice  

The above documents are proprietary to Intercontinental Exchange, and are only supplied to relevant customers if they have entered into a contract with Intercontinental Exchange.

The users will have to remove all ICE Specification documents at the above URLs in order to remedy this infringement.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you.
