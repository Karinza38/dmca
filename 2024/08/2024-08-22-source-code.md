Please be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under copyright law a developer platform, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If developer platforms do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing materials from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
