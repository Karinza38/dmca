Dear GitHub Support,

I am the [private] and [private] of ObscuraLua, a Lua obfuscator service. I am writing to report multiple instances of copyright infringement on GitHub. These repositories contain unauthorized use of our Lua obfuscator (ObscuraLua). We recently experienced breaches of our access, and now people are utilizing our Lua obfuscator illegally.

Our latest version, 1.1.0, has not been released to the public due to this unauthorized action

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely, [private]  
[private] and [private],  
ObscuraLua
