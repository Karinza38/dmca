Hello,  
In December of 2023, [private] wrote a newspaper article and took pictures about composting in [private] school district and a school club. Two of those pictures, located under the headings "City High's Environmental Club" and "The Plan for the Future" are being used without [private] consent on an unrelated website for a nonprofit called "The Golden Beaker" under the heading "Our Programs" and above the subheadings "STEM Outreach Program" and "At-Home STEM Kits." Their website is hosted on Github. They have not asked for [private] permission and do not have [private] permission to use these photographs. I have asked them to take the photos down and they have not done so.

Here is the URL to [private] newspaper article with [private] copyrighted content: https://www.thelittlehawk.com/63451/news/environmental-club-helps-take-composting-programs-district-wide/  
Her is the URL where [private] copyrighted content is being infringed upon: https://thegoldenbeaker.org/programs.html

You can reach me at [private] and my phone number is [private].

I believe that the information I have provided is accurate and complete and that the use of the photographs is not within the scope of fair use. I am the owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

If you need further explanation on the copyrighted content being infringed upon, please let me know.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
 
I have taken fair use into consideration.
 
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice
