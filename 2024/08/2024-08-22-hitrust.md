**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The technological measures we have in place are as follows:  
1. Private [private]: All sensitive and proprietary code is stored in private [private] on [private], accessible only to authorized users.  
2. Permission Management:  
o Role-Based Permissions: Access permissions are set according to user roles (e.g., Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer) to ensure that users can only perform actions necessary for their role.  
o Group Permissions: Permissions are managed at a higher level through [private] groups to ensure that only specific groups have access to the relevant resources.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The account holder is suspected to have previously been granted access to our repository and uploaded proprietary code to their own private repository. It is possible that their action of transferring the code to a private repository bypassed our technological protection measures due to their prior authorization.
