**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] of MokletDev, the organization that owns the original repository moklet-twibbon on GitHub, which is licensed under GPL v3. As the [private] and [private] of this repository, I have full authorization to act on behalf of the copyright owner. Our code has been improperly copied and claimed by another party without attribution, in violation of the GPL v3 license terms.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a repository named moklet-twibbon, which is a software project hosted on GitHub under the organization MokletDev. This repository contains source code for a web-based application designed to create and manage digital frames (twibbons). The project is licensed under the GPL v3 license, requiring any derivative works to provide proper attribution and to be distributed under the same license.

The original repository can be accessed at the following URL: https://github.com/mokletdev/moklet-twibbon.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository bikin-twibbon should be taken down as it contains the infringing code copied from our original repository. The infringing repository can be found at the following URL:

https://github.com/irfan-za/bikin-twibbon

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, I have not searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing repository. I am currently focused on the primary repository that directly infringes on our copyrighted work.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Yes, the work is licensed under the GPL v3 open source license."

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The GPL v3 license requires that any redistributed code or derivative works must provide proper attribution to the original authors and be licensed under the same GPL v3 license. The alleged infringing repository bikin-twibbon contains code copied from our repository moklet-twibbon without providing the required attribution or including the GPL v3 license terms. This constitutes a violation of the GPL v3 license terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the GPL v3 license, the following changes should be made:

1. Attribution: Properly attribute the original work by including a clear reference to the moklet-twibbon repository and its authors.  
2. License: Include the full GPL v3 license text in the repository and ensure that any derivative works are also licensed under GPL v3.  
3. Source Code: Provide access to the complete source code of the infringing project, including any modifications, to ensure transparency and compliance with GPL v3 requirements.  

If these changes are not feasible, the repository should be taken down to prevent further violations.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The best solution for the alleged infringement would be to:

1. Remove the Infringing Repository: Take down the entire bikin-twibbon repository to stop the distribution of the unlicensed and improperly attributed code.  
2. Notify the Infringing Party: Contact the owner of the bikin-twibbon repository to inform them of the infringement and provide them with the opportunity to resolve the issue by complying with the GPL v3 license terms.  
3. Ensure Compliance: If the infringing party wishes to continue using or distributing the code, they must properly attribute the original work, include the GPL v3 license text, and ensure that all derivative works are also licensed under GPL v3.

Taking these steps will help ensure that the terms of the GPL v3 license are respected and that the original work is properly credited.
