Hello Github support team,

A Capgemini's ex-employee is hosting a public repo with copyrighted material he helped develop during his employment at the company including our brand name and logomark. Since the user doesn't work at Capgemini anymore he has effectively breached his contract and is viable to being sued for his actions, but we would like to the repo to be removed from Github first to prevent or limit the consequences of having our intellectual property openly available on the Internet.

Since I work in Capgemini's [private] I was assigned a ticket from one of our external monitoring systems about this public repo and hereby requested the takedown of our copyrighted material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The whole repo publicly available under https://github.com/samuelsoaress/Cap-Dev-Exame form the user https://github.com/samuelsoaress should be taken down for hosting copyrighted content, including but not limited to code developed during the user employment at Capgemini, the use of "Cap", the short version of our company name, at the repo name and URL, and the use of our corporate logo in the readme of the repo (https://github.com/samuelsoaress/Cap-Dev-Exame/blob/master/dev-exam-frontend/src/assets/img/capgemini-logo.jpg).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The whole repository should be taken down https://github.com/samuelsoaress/Cap-Dev-Exame

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There seems to be no fork of this repo but it and all branches should be taken down, such as:  
https://github.com/samuelsoaress/Cap-Dev-Exame

https://github.com/samuelsoaress/Cap-Dev-Exame/tree/develop  
https://github.com/samuelsoaress/Cap-Dev-Exame/tree/develop-breno  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The repository should be taken down permanently to prevent further damages to our copyrighted material.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The repo's owner doesn't work at Capgemini anymore and we don't have his contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
