I hope this message finds you well. I am an [private] at Microsoft, and [private] team is responsible for the following productivity tools within [private]: [private], [private], [private] (Public documentation to the same https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/productivity-tools).  
I am writing to bring to your attention a critical issue regarding the repository "https://github.com/MadhaviChidaraboyina/CRM.Omnichannel.ProductivityTools". This repository contains an exact copy of Microsoft product code that was not intended for publicly available. Unfortunately, one of our users inadvertently uploaded this code to the public repository and did not realize the mistake at the time.  
The user in question no longer has access to the repository due to a change in their corporate email address from [private] to [private]. As a result, they are unable to take the necessary actions to either make the repository private or remove it entirely.  
We urgently request your assistance in addressing this matter to ensure the code is either taken down or made private as soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.
