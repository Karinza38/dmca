Hello, the code I am reporting is a government project developed by us and has strict confidentiality, so it cannot be made public. The code can only run on our local area network, and the copyright of the code belongs entirely to us. Through the code submission record, it can be seen that it was submitted using the [private] account. This is my account, but it was not submitted by me. Hackers stole my account and stole the code on my computer. Please help me delete the sensitive repository code. Thank you very much.

Hello, the original version of the work is a system used by the government to manage civilian explosive materials, including some workflows, video surveillance, and warehouse management, with high confidentiality. However, it was stolen by hackers and placed in a public warehouse, which not only infringes but also exposes sensitive information，
Because the system can only run on a local area network, it cannot provide access URLs. I am very sorry, please help me delete infringing and sensitive code repositories. Thank you very much
