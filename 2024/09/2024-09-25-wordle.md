**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We represent The New York Times Company (“The Times”), the owner of the famous and widely known WORDLE game . I am authorized to submit this Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) takedown notice regarding copyright infringement on a GitHub hosted website. The GitHub hosted website https://wordleplusplus.com/ displays content that infringes on our client’s intellectual property rights including copyright and trademark.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

By way of background, On January 24, 2022, The Times purchased the popular word game “Wordle” (and all associated intellectual property rights with the game) from [private] [private], including but not limited to the common-law trademark rights to the “Wordle” trademark, the copyright in the game and visuals of the game, and the trade dress associated with the game. The Times’s acquisition of the game was widely reported in widely available news sources. The official Wordle game can be found here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. The Times therefore owns all copyrights of the WORDLE game.

The infringing website reported herein displays The Times’ copyrighted content imitating the WORDLE game without The Times’ consent or approval. In particular, the website contains a knock off of the same copyrighted Wordle puzzle owned by The Times. The layout, color scheme, and gameplay are identical to The Times’s “Wordle” game. The infringing website also uses The Times’s “Wordle” trademark without authorization. Clearly, this is a blatant attempt to trade off The Times’s well-known “Wordle” brand and confuse consumers into believing they are playing a legitimate religious version of the Wordle game, when they are not. As the infringing website’s host and now having knowledge of the infringement, you may be found liable for contributory infringement. We therefore demand the infringing website be removed immediately.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**
