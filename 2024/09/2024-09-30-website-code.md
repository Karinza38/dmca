- [private] (also at [private])
- [private] (also at [private])

All of the content on these articles has been copied, including the images. They have switched out [private] name for theirs and inserted these stolen articles onto their own website (which is hosted by Github).

A previous version of [private] repository was licensed under the GNU AGPL v3. However, even if you assume they used the version of [private] site that was under the AGPL, they are still violating the license since the infringing repository is unlicensed, there is no notice that it is a modified work, they have not linked back to the original source, and have not kept the original copyright notice.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Sasquatch9228/sasquatch9228.github.io

That repository contains the files for the Github Pages deployment located at https://sasquatch9228.dev/.

These are the specific directories that contain the copyrighted content:

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No, but a previous version of [private] repository was licensed under the GNU AGPL v3. The current revision of it is all rights reserved.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed. Even if this user had used the AGPL licensed version, it would be impossible for him to legally comply with it since the repository also contains code taken from other unlicensed projects by different people.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
