**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A Flutter/Dart package named "data_connection_checker" is hosted on pub.dev (https://pub.dev/packages/data_connection_checker). This package is no longer continued, as indicated by the author of another package, "internet_connection_checker" (https://pub.dev/packages/internet_connection_checker). To continue the functionality of the original package, the author of "internet_connection_checker" created a new package with the name "internet_connection_checker" and the same license as "data_connection_checker."

Noticing that "internet_connection_checker" did not support the web platform for Flutter apps, [private] cloned the package's contents under fair use, modified it to support the web platform, and published it on pub.dev under the name "internet_connection_checker_plus" (https://pub.dev/packages/internet_connection_checker_plus). [private] included the original license, credited the authors of both "data_connection_checker" and "internet_connection_checker," and, after making substantial changes, added my own license for my copyrighted work while retaining the original license.

Recently, the author of "internet_connection_checker" published a new version (v2.0.0) of their package on pub.dev. Upon investigation, I found that this version contains code strikingly similar to mine. This suspicion is supported by a GitHub commit that references the name of my package within their code (https://github.com/RounakTadvi/internet_connection_checker/blob/79a8ad9eee5de2ff3061c25537aaefb33d1ae01f/lib/internet_connection.dart#L19-L46), without giving me credit or including my license for the copyrighted work. I reached out to the author via email, requesting that they either credit me or take down the published package, but they haven't taken any action yet.
