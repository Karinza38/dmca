Hi,

I am looking to file a DMCA takedown on GitHub.

Here is the situation: [private] have been working on a project for about a year now. We have a private repository on [private], which [private] own. Recently, someone gained unauthorized access to our work and published it on GitHub in two different repositories. The code belongs to [private], and I want to remove these repositories containing our source code.

The original repo (which is private) can be found here: [private]

As you can see from the commit history, we do indeed have ownership over this project and its code: 

[private]  

We have used GitHub back and forth to hold our code and collaborate as we make more progress in our project. This project is under copyright as well.

The infringing repos are as follows:  
Lil-Skiirrtt/KaguraClientV2Source: This Source code is leaked by [private] The most hated person of PS3 Enjoy! Bisous [private], Je t'aime mon b√©bou plein de peinture Framboise C: (github.com)

Lil-Skiirrtt/Old-KaguraClientV2-Source: Old source of Kagura Client that can be used to add offsets from [private] source to the old source (sln format) (github.com)

As you can see, these are the following repos that contain published code that do not belong to the publisher "Lil-Skiirrtt". They didn't even bother giving credit to [private] or anyone else working on the project. They have published [private] code which is both of the contents of both repos. Any folders containing C++ PS3-related source code is included. The project files and headers, cpp files, and more are all under [private] ownership and not the publisher's.

The project in question is the "Kagura Client" also known as the "Kagura SPRX"  
This is a Minecraft PlayStation 3 project that [private] have been working on for quite a while now. The newest version of our works has been leaked and published by "Lil-Skiirrtt" who is the name of the one publishing our code and we would like this to be taken down immediately. They have gone ahead and published our code without any permission and have not given any kind of credit to us. 

The repos can be found here if the previous links did not work:  
Our project (private): [private]

[private]  

The repo with the leaked code: https://github.com/Lil-Skiirrtt/Old-KaguraClientV2-Source  
The other repo with the leaked code: https://github.com/Lil-Skiirrtt/KaguraClientV2Source

By looking at the dates and commit history, it is easy to see how the original version (which is a private repo that [private] am the owner of) is older and has existed for much longer when we first started collaborating using GitHub.

As you can see, these two repos have our C++ PS3 menu source code within them. The Kagura code is the specific project in question. The project source code is related to rendering a menu on a PlayStation 3 console with game functions and controls. 

This has been done with full knowledge of the works being under my ownership and I would like these to be removed as none of it belongs to them:

[private]

My repo

[private]  

We intend to keep our code private until the project is finished, and it is simply outrageous that someone has both gotten access to it and published it. That, without even giving credit to the contributors involved.

(I would hope that none of my personal information is shared with anyone...)
