**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I [private] a repository "FaeSector" that was copied by one of [private] contributors and then had a license retroactively added to it after said contributor advised me to remove the license from [private] own repository.  
Originally, the repository had a BSD-3-Clause but that was removed upon request of the contributor who then used that opportunity to copy the entire repository and place the same license on it, now claiming that he "owns the mod" and he has begun to advertise the mod as his own which goes against the original BSD-3-Clause license that [private] repository had and now has.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is a Mod for the game "Starsector" created by [private] and [private] who handles the creative side of things.

https://github.com/auntiebing/FaeSector This is the link to the repository owned by [private].

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire copied repository should be deleted.

https://github.com/DeCEll-1/Fae this is the link to the copied repository that had an license added to it after it was copied from my repository.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not found any forks made of the infringing repository

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

BSD-3-Clause

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The owner of the copied repository is using his own version of a BSD-3-Clause license and is claiming the mod as his own and advertising it as such, which he does not have written permission to do and is thus in violation of the license on the original repository

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The repository should be entirely deleted, or have [private] BSD-3-Clause license added to it which would make it not infringe on the terms of the license on [private] repository that he has copied

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
