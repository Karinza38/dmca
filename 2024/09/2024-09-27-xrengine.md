**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

These works are in violation of my copyright, as well as in violation of the original MIT license terms set out in the license I created.

1. They are using my work without consent or permission, in fact I have explicit told them to cease  
2. This is not a fork or derived work-- they took the actual codebase and changed the name and license  
3. They changed the MIT license from the original org to a new org  
4. They then changed the MIT license to another kind of license  
5. This is a clone / separate remote of https://github.com/etherealengine/etherealengine which was already taken down due to DMCA

Yes but there are no active forks and these are the main offenders.

Yes

It was licensed as MIT but the offending party changed the license to a restricted license, after changing who the MIT License was to

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The attribution on the license was changed, then the license type was change. here are the commits which show these changes.

First, this changes the name to "Ethereal Engine, formerly XR Foundation". As XR Foundation was an entity I had created, this is not a true statement.  
[invalid]  

The original work was fully renamed, without permission or consent of the original creators, and the "formerly XR Foundation" was removed:  
[invalid]

Lastly, the license was completely changed to another type of license (CPAL), in complete violation of the previous MIT license.  
[invalid]

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The project needs to revert to an MIT license, crediting XREngine, the original project and name on the MIT license as published.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
