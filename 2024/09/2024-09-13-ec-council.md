**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Several links that your website is hosting are infringing on at least one (1) if not more copyrights(s) owned by EC-Council. The course materials of EC-Council official courses like “Certified Ethical Hacker - CEH”, is being uploaded unlawfully through your website without permission and in blatant violation of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, EC-Council is the owner and developer of the course “Certified Ethical Hacker” and owns copyright in all its versions which [private] has illegally uploaded through its GitHub Account - imrk51. The customers seeking EC-Council’s courses may be misled into thinking that the infringing content and courses uploaded are endorsed or affiliated with EC-Council. As a result of the misrepresentation caused by the account owner, EC-Council is likely to suffer damage in the form of loss of sales, damage to its reputation, and further risks confusing our clients. We assert that this is a clear intent of riding freely on the goodwill of EC-Council.
