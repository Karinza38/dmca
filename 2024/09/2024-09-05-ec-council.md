Several links that your website is hosting are infringing on at least one (1) if not more copyrights(s) owned by EC-Council.

The customers seeking EC-Council’s courses may be misled into thinking that the infringing content and courses uploaded are endorsed or affiliated with EC-Council. As a result of the misrepresentation caused by the account owner, EC-Council is likely to suffer damage in the form of loss of sales, damage to its reputation, and further risks confusing our clients.
