While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of a project called Tori Launcher. The entire codebase, including all original code and documentation, was created by [private]. As such, I hold the copyright to this work by virtue of its creation. I have not authorized any third party to distribute or host this code publicly. Therefore, the publication of this code on GitHub without my consent constitutes a violation of my copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is a custom Minecraft launcher named Tori Launcher (can be found on [private] [private]), and about 3 months ago in some form the source code of this project ended up on a different, public repository which can be found at https://github.com/aubreyrs/ToriClient. My project is a custom built launcher specifically to launch a modified/modded version of Minecraft that is called "Tori Client", a client specifically focused on the more competitive side of the Minecraft community. The work in question however is closed-source, and the source code has not been shared to anyone, as we have competition attempting to steal our work, and the source code should not be in any other hands due to this. This client is a small project with a growing community. More information can be found at [private], as our website, https://toriclient.com/, has not been fully set up yet. You can also contact me on there if needed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be taken down.  
https://github.com/aubreyrs/ToriClient

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The code in my project is encrypted and obfuscated using many different sources to protect the most important parts in all public releases, and is packaged into one file. This ensures that the code should be unreadable to the naked eye, and that it is harder to decrypt/deobfuscate and read the original code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This project appears to have somehow decompiled or deobfuscated my project to spread the source code on the public internet.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have, and I have not found anything.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
