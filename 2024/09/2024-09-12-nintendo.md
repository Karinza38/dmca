The Nintendo Switch console and video games contain technological protection measures (“TPMs”) that permit the Nintendo Switch console to interact only with legitimate Nintendo video game files. This process protects Nintendo’s copyright-protected video games, including but not limited to those covered by U.S. Copyright Registration numbers PA0002213509 (Super Mario Maker 2); PA0002233840 (Animal Crossing: New Horizons); PA0002213908 (Luigi’s Mansion 3); and PA0002028142 (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) by preventing users from playing pirated copies of Nintendo’s video games on the Nintendo Switch console and by preventing users from unlawfully copying and playing Nintendo’s video games on unauthorized devices.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Nintendo embeds TPMs in both the Nintendo Switch console and video game files, including but not limited to encryption of the video game files which requires certain cryptographic keys, such as prod.keys, that are used to verify, access, and play each game played on the Nintendo Switch. The TPMs employ encryption as described in more detail below.  
  
The Nintendo Switch console allows users either to play games on physical cartridges that are inserted into the console, or to play games digitally downloaded from Nintendo’s server. Both formats are protected by Nintendo’s TPMs, including encryption of its video games. When a game is started on the Nintendo Switch console the games are decrypted and verified using various Nintendo cryptographic keys so they may be played. Nintendo owns or exclusively controls numerous copyrights in software and games that are protected from unlawful access and copying by the operation of these TPMs. In their ordinary course of operation, the TPMs require the application of information and a process (as described above), with the authority of Nintendo, to gain access to Nintendo’s copyrighted works, and thus effectively control access to and copying of Nintendo’s copyrighted works.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The reported repositories offer and provide access to the yuzu emulator or code based on the yuzu emulator (specifically, a program called Nuzu). The yuzu emulator is primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games. Specifically, yuzu illegally circumvents Nintendo’s technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games. Nintendo Switch games are encrypted using proprietary cryptographic keys (prod.keys) which protect against unauthorized access to and copying of the copyrighted games. During operation, yuzu necessarily uses unauthorized copies of these cryptographic keys to decrypt unauthorized copies of Nintendo Switch games, or ROMs, at or immediately before runtime without Nintendo’s authorization. Thus, yuzu is primarily designed to unlawfully “circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under” the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1). Therefore distribution of yuzu constitutes unlawful “traffic[king] in a[] technology ... that ... is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure....” in violation of Section 1201 of the DMCA.

We are happy to provide an additional copy if needed.)
