**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

To ensure the protection and proper licensing of our copyrighted material, we at MDBootstrap have implemented several technological measures. These measures are designed to control access to the MDBootstrap Pro components, enforce our licensing terms, and prevent unauthorized use. Here’s a detailed breakdown of these measures:

Authentication and Authorization Systems  
User Accounts: Users must create an account and log in to access and download MDBootstrap Pro components. This system verifies that each user has a valid license before they can access the protected content.
License Key Activation: Each purchase of MDBootstrap Pro comes with a unique license key that users must activate. This system checks the validity of the license and ensures that it has not been used on more devices than allowed under the terms of the license.

Regular Software Updates and Patches  
We frequently update our software to address any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass our security measures. These updates also enhance the functionality of our components, encouraging users to maintain a legitimate license to access the latest versions.

Monitoring and Compliance Checks  
Usage Monitoring: We monitor the use of our software to detect and respond to potential unauthorized use. This includes tracking the number of installations and active sessions for each license.
Compliance Audits: Periodic audits help ensure that all users comply with the terms of their licenses. Non-compliance detected during these audits leads to enforcement actions.

Legal and Technical Notices  
Each component of MDBootstrap Pro includes legal notices within the code and documentation, clarifying the copyright ownership and usage restrictions. These notices are intended to deter infringement and educate users about their legal obligations.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

1. Bypassing Authentication and Authorization  
License Key Emulation or Sharing: The accused project could include tools or methods to emulate or share license keys, allowing users to bypass the requirement for each user to have a unique, valid license.    
Account Sharing or Creation of Unauthorized Access Points: The project might facilitate or encourage the sharing of user accounts among multiple individuals, or it might provide unauthorized access through backdoors or other means that bypass normal user authentication.  
2. Neutralizing Regular Software Updates and Patches    
Blocking Update Mechanisms: The accused project might modify MDBootstrap Pro components to block or redirect communication with update servers, preventing the application from receiving updates that could patch security holes or disable unauthorized copies.
Distributing Modified Versions: The project could distribute versions of the software that have been modified to include previous vulnerabilities or to disable functionalities intended to enforce compliance with new updates.  
3. Circumventing Monitoring and Compliance Checks  
Disabling or Interfering with Monitoring Tools: The project may include methods to disable the monitoring functionalities that track installations and usage, or it might falsify the data sent to these monitoring systems.  
Avoiding Compliance Audits: Techniques such as IP masking, use of virtual machines, or other methods could be employed to avoid detection during compliance audits.   
4. Ignoring Legal and Technical Notices    
Removal of Copyright Notices and Warnings: The accused project might strip out the legal notices and copyright warnings from the code and documentation, making it less likely for users to be aware of the illegality of their actions or the potential consequences.  
Action Steps  
If such circumvention methods are confirmed through a technical examination of the accused project, you would need to pursue remedies including:

Immediate Cease and Desist Requests: Demand an immediate takedown of the infringing content through legal notices or DMCA takedown requests to hosting platforms.
Legal Action: If the takedown is not effective, further legal action might be necessary to enforce copyright laws and protect your intellectual property.
Public Communication: Inform your user base of the risks associated with using unauthorized versions of your software, potentially including security risks and lack of support.
