We are CR Vanguard Co., Ltd., a first-level profit center under China Resources Group. We are one of the largest retail chain enterprises in China. I am an [private] in the network security post of CR Vanguard Co., Ltd. Recently, we found that on GitHub, there is some source code information and system operation instruction documents related to our company's old systems (including CR Vanguard terminal ticketing system, ewj CR Vanguard training, CR Vanguard PC-side mall project, CR Vanguard online retail project, and CR Vanguard marketing H5 project). The copyrights of these systems are solely owned by our company. Users exposing this information on GitHub has violated our company's legitimate rights and interests and involved our company's privacy. It may cause leakage of the company's sensitive information and pose security risks. Therefore, the company has granted me the power. I hereby represent the company to file a copyright complaint for the infringing content on GitHub. I hope GitHub can delete and take down the relevant content. Thank you!

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The allegedly infringed copyrighted works include the source code and system operation instruction documents of several of our company's internal systems. These systems consist of the CR Vanguard terminal ticketing system, ewj CR Vanguard training, CR Vanguard PC-side mall project, CR Vanguard online retail project, and CR Vanguard marketing H5 project. As of now, we do not have specific URLs for these works as they are old projects that we no longer use. However, posting information related to these systems on GitHub without our permission still poses a security risk to our company and infringes on our legitimate rights and interests. Therefore, we request that GitHub delete and take down these contents.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
