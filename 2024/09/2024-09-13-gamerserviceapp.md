This is the second DMCA takedown notice we are forced to submit, as [private] has again uploaded copies that infringe our copyrights.
After the prior DMCA takedown notice was submitted (https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/08/2024-08-15-gamerserverapp.md), and the repository with the infringing contents was removed by Github as a result, the person uploaded the same copyright infringing file to a new repository.

Since this person is repeatedly infringing (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#f-repeated-infringement) our copyrights, using GitHub as the distribution platform, we demand that GitHub takes appropriate actions to prevent further infringement of our copyrights, now and in the future.  
If no definitive actions are taken, we will be forced to pursue legal measures to protect our intellectual property, including potential action against GitHub.
