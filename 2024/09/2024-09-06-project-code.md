Hello Github,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the [private] of the copyrighted material at: https://github.com/codyjack/Pintos  
Additionally, the following forks from `codyjack/Pintos` are also infringing:

- https://github.com/shivamar/Pintos-2
- https://github.com/Shawn-Armstrong/Pintos
- https://github.com/morphisjustfun/Pintos-1
- https://github.com/lagabulin/Pintos
- https://github.com/AlfredsJunior/Pintos
- https://github.com/Abishai521/Pintos
- https://github.com/aadishesh16/Pintos-2
- https://github.com/rovinbhandari/Pintos-1

I am alleging that the entire repository is infringing on my copyrighted material, which you can see reflected in the git commits for the repository.

As you can see on GitHub, all of the commits belong to [private], not "codyjack". This repository was likely cloned and pushed to a new repo, which is why it isn't marked as a fork. [private] deleted [private] own repository several years ago at the request of a college educator who had students copy pasting from [private] project to pass their class. Recently this week, another college educator pointed [private] to this repository, which contains all of [private] work and commit history, but is hosted on a different users profile from [private] own.

Currently, [private] repo has been deleted from [private] account and GitHub, but repos like this, and the several forks from this repo referenced in this report still exist, unmodified from [private] original project.

The user 'codyjack' would need to remove this repo from their account entirely. I have no way to do this myself, as I do not have access to the account.

My contact information is:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Signed, [private]
