GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the original [private] and copyright owner of the repository in question. The code was published under the GNU General Public License v3.0, which requires attribution and that any modifications or redistributions comply with the same license. The individual in question has deobfuscated, modified, and redistributed the code without providing proper credit or adhering to the terms of the GPL v3.0.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a software repository [private] and [private] on GitHub under the GNU General Public License v3.0. The repository contains a Roblox Sniping Tool. The repository is available at https://github.com/Aspectise/Free-Limited-Sniper. The code includes specific functionalities and structures that were deobfuscated, modified, and redistributed without credit or adherence to the GPL v3.0 license terms. The infringing party has altered the source code without proper attribution and has violated the license conditions under which the original code was released.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository contains infringing material, and all files within have been modified and redistributed without proper credit or adherence to the license terms. Please take down the entire repository. The URL to the infringing repository is: https://github.com/AlikSusFootages/CloudDeath.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have checked for any forks of the allegedly infringing repository, and none of them are found to be infringing.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

The work is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

I believe the license is being violated because the code from my repository, which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3), has been deobfuscated, modified, and redistributed without proper attribution or compliance with the GPLv3 terms. Specifically, the infringing party did not provide the required attribution or release the modified code under the same GPLv3 license.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Given that the code has been deobfuscated, modified, and redistributed without proper attribution or compliance with the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3), and considering that the distribution was done with malicious intent, there is no way to bring the project into compliance. Therefore, I request that the entire infringing repository be removed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have specific contact information for the group or the individual responsible. I only know that they are part of a group based in [private].

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
