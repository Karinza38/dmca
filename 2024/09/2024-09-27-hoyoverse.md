**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

COGNOSPHERE's online game, Genshin: Impact, incorporates Technological Protection Measures (TPMs) to safeguard its game data and intellectual property. These TPMs include encryption and signature checks to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the game's data. Unlike physical consoles, Genshin: Impact is played exclusively online, and all game data, including character information and other critical game elements, are protected by these TPMs.

The TPMs in Genshin: Impact are designed to block unauthorized access, extraction, and decryption of the game's cryptographic data. This includes ensuring that only legitimate users can access the game's character data and other sensitive information. By implementing these security measures, COGNOSPHERE effectively controls access to its copyrighted works and prevents illegal copying and distribution.

In accordance with COGNOSPHERE's terms of service, users are prohibited from copying, reproducing, distributing, or publishing any non-public information obtained from the game. These terms explicitly forbid any actions that violate COGNOSPHERE's proprietary rights and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the United States (specifically, 17 U.S.C. §1201). Unauthorized access or distribution ofGenshin: Impact's data not only infringes upon COGNOSPHERE's copyrights but also breaches the agreed-upon terms of service, subjecting violators to potential legal consequences.

COGNOSPHERE maintains ownership of all rights, titles, and interests in Genshin: Impact, including intellectual property rights, neighboring rights, and other related interests. The company takes stringent measures to protect its game and ensure that users cannot exploit or redistribute its content without express permission. Any unauthorized modification, copying, or distribution of the game's data is strictly prohibited and may lead to severe legal penalties.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The reported repository offers and provides access to data that has not been officially released, infringing on COGNOSPHERE's intellectual property rights. Specifically, the repository provides "unpacked data" to users. This data was obtained by bypassing COGNOSPHERE’s Technological Measures for video games. Our TPMs are designed to prevent unauthorized access to, extraction of, and decryption of all cryptographic data, including character data. The decrypted data facilitates copyright infringement by allowing users to access COGNOSPHERE’s copyright-protected game data without permission. This action violates our terms of service, specifically section 2.d, which prohibits reporting, publishing, disclosing, or otherwise transferring any of our non-public information (https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/company/terms). Additionally, this conduct violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the United States (specifically, 17 U.S.C. §1201), and infringes upon copyrights owned by COGNOSPHERE.
