While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the company that owns this software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

An [private] of ours tried to extort us for money after we fired him. He threatened that he would violate the nondisclosure agree that he signed and publicly post our projects, and he just did. I have inserted a copy of this threat here as there is no way of attaching a file:

[private]  


User: expressodaily

Projects (so far; they were just posted an hour ago, and we were notified by a bot named [private]):  
- https://github.com/expressodaily/sellback_application  
- https://github.com/expressodaily/sellback_website  
- https://github.com/expressodaily/mobile_retail_application  
- https://github.com/expressodaily/mobile_retail_website  
- https://github.com/expressodaily/admin_application  
- https://github.com/expressodaily/admin_website  

These are private projects and he has no rights to access to any of them. You'll notice that there are original, older copies under our organization ("outandbackoutdoor") and that he is no longer even a member of our organization as of several weeks ago.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

These repositories:  
https://github.com/expressodaily/sellback_application  
https://github.com/expressodaily/sellback_website  
https://github.com/expressodaily/mobile_retail_application  
https://github.com/expressodaily/mobile_retail_website  
https://github.com/expressodaily/admin_application

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

They are private in [private]. Additionally, permissions are compartmentalized to limit access to the teams that should have access to them. The only reason [private] had access was because he was paid for services rendered until we terminated his employment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

They have merely uploaded these repositories to their own accounts. They have seemingly not taken steps to prevent copyright protections, nor has Github prevented them from doing so.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

As of this time, no forks appear to exist (all projects report (0) forks).

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
