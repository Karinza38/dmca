**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the software, Flap Client, which was developed, maintained, and distributed exclusively by [private]. [private] hold exclusive rights to this software, including all associated intellectual property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The software is distributed exclusively through authorized channels, and I have not given permission for it to be cracked or redistributed by third parties. You can view the official distribution site at [private].

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository, located at https://github.com/WalmartSolutions/Flap-Client, contains the cracked version of [private] software. I request the complete takedown of this repository.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

My software, Flap Client, is protected by a licensing system that requires each user to verify their purchase and obtain a unique license key to activate the software. This licensing system restricts unauthorized access by validating each user’s license key through our servers. Without a valid license key, the software cannot be fully utilized. This protection effectively prevents unauthorized users from accessing the full functionality of the software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repository in question appears to contain a "cracked" version of my software, which bypasses or disables the license verification system. By removing the need for a valid license key, this circumvention allows unauthorized users to access and use the software without proper licensing, directly undermining the technological measures we have in place to protect our copyrighted material.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have reviewed the repository listings on GitHub, but I have not identified any direct forks of this repository at the time of this report. However, I request GitHub’s assistance in monitoring for forks that may be created in the future, as they could contain the same infringing material.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have the alleged infringer's contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
