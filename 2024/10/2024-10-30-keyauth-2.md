This project infringes upon my copyright and violates the anti-circumvention clause of the DMCA by releasing a program meant to circumvent [private] software, enabling people to commit piracy. I request immediate removal.

All files in this project violate my copyright https://github.com/CabboShiba/KeyAuth-Server-Emulator I request a takedown of the entire repository, all files are infringing.

The project owner discusses tampering with my protection and security checks https://github.com/CabboShiba/KeyAuth-Server-Emulator/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L92

The project owner also bruteforces my software, another violation of anti-circumvention copyright laws https://github.com/CabboShiba/KeyAuth-Server-Emulator/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L45

The code https://github.com/CabboShiba/KeyAuth-Server-Emulator/blob/main/KeyAuthServerEmulator/KeyAuthHelper/Cryptography/Cryptography.cs#L33-L128 is also stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/80e0f92b4500c36ec8de34555a0e7c194e6848a5/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L1105-L1203

This violates my copyright license which is not open source, and states "You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license key functionality
in the software" which clearly, this project directly intents to violate.
