I am the [private] and [private] of the SmokeySpoofer repository, which contains unique code and documentation that [private] developed. [private] have full rights to the intellectual property associated with this project and am authorized to act on [private] behalf to enforce [private] rights.

As the [private] of SmokeySpoofer, I am committed to maintaining the integrity of [private] work and protecting users from cloned or scam versions of [private] software. I request your assistance in taking down any unauthorized or misleading repositories that impersonate [private] original work.

The original copyrighted work in question is [private] GitHub repository titled SmokeySpoofer, which can be found at the following URL: [invalid].

Details:

Nature of Work: SmokeySpoofer is a software tool designed to spoof hardware identifiers (HWIDs) on Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. It is intended for legitimate use, such as enhancing privacy and security for users.  
Content: The repository contains original code, documentation, and instructional materials that [private] developed, including algorithms and techniques unique to this specific HWID spoofer.
Date of Creation: The project was initiated and published in [insert creation date here] and has been actively maintained and updated since its release.
Purpose: The purpose of SmokeySpoofer is to provide users with a reliable method to protect their privacy and avoid hardware bans in gaming and other applications.
Infringement Issue: I have discovered multiple cloned repositories that not only misrepresent themselves as legitimate versions of SmokeySpoofer but also attempt to spread malware and other harmful software to unsuspecting users. These cloned repositories compromise user security and trust, which goes against the principles of the GitHub community.

I kindly request your assistance in taking down these cloned and fraudulent repositories that infringe upon [private] original work and jeopardize user safety.
