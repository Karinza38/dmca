While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the Basilisk web browser and its associated official branding files. The official branding files are proprietary and copyrighted exclusively by [private], and they are not licensed for public distribution or use outside of officially endorsed versions of the Basilisk browser. As the copyright holder, I have the exclusive right to control the use and distribution of these files. No authorization has been granted to third parties to distribute or use these files, and their unauthorized presence in this repository violates my copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work in question is the official branding files for the Basilisk web browser. These files include logos, icons, and other branding assets that are integral to the official version of the Basilisk browser and are protected under copyright law. These branding files are proprietary and are only allowed to be used and distributed by me, the owner, or with my explicit permission.

The original work can only be found within the official releases of the Basilisk web browser, which are distributed solely through my authorized channels.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following files and folder, which are unauthorized copies of my copyrighted official branding files, should be taken down:

• Repository URL: https://github.com/noobsoftware/silver2  
• Folder containing copyrighted files: https://github.com/noobsoftware/silver2/tree/main/basilisk/branding/official

All files within the “official” folder under the “branding” directory in the repository above are copyrighted by me and are not authorized for public distribution. Therefore, I request that all these files be removed immediately to prevent further unauthorized distribution of my copyrighted material.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The official branding files for the Basilisk web browser are stored in a [private], which is secured and accessible only to specific trusted parties. Access to this repository is tightly controlled through permissions and is granted only to authorized individuals who have been given explicit permission to use these files. The [private] is not publicly accessible, ensuring that the files are not available for public download or distribution. These measures effectively control access to my copyrighted material by preventing unauthorized access and distribution, thereby protecting my intellectual property rights.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project, hosted on a public GitHub repository, has bypassed my technological protection measures by unauthorizedly copying and distributing the official branding files from my [private]. These files are intended to be kept private and accessible only to specific trusted parties. By making these files publicly available, the accused project circumvents the access controls I have in place, allowing anyone to download and use my copyrighted material without authorization. This unauthorized distribution undermines the effectiveness of my protective measures by making the files accessible to the public in violation of my copyright.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I am not aware of any forks of the allegedly infringing repository at this time. If any forks are discovered that also contain the copyrighted material, I will submit separate DMCA takedown requests for those repositories as well.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have the alleged infringer’s contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
