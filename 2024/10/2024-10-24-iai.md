Dear GitHub Legal Team,

I am writing on behalf of Israel Aerospace Industries (“IAI”), a corporation based in Israel, and I am authorized to act on its behalf regarding matters of intellectual property infringement.

We have recently discovered that the GitHub repository located at https://github.com/cmd96/MHTProject contains proprietary and confidential information that belongs to IAI, including commercial secrets related to how we store and manage data. This material was created as part of a past student program at IAI, and was uploaded without authorization by an individual who is no longer affiliated with our organization. Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to contact this individual to resolve the matter directly.

The repository contains sensitive information, which may cause significant harm to our organization if publicly accessible. As such, we request that GitHub take immediate action to remove this repository in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is a classified project that not stored anywhere online.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/cmd96/MHTProject

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Can’t find the user information since it’s wrapped up in a user name ‘cmd96’ that can be anyone.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
