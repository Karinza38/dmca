Based on additional review, GitHub has determined that the notice does not meet the requirements of our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy) because we found that the contact information was insufficient. 

Accordingly, GitHub has decided to reject this counter notice. Please note, should the respondent provide additional information, we will review it against our DMCA Takedown Policy to determine if additional action is necessary.
