**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the service RestoreCord. [private] the code seen here https://github.com/wnelson03/RestoreCord-Source-Code
Proof of copyright ownership can be viewed here [private], [private] the [private] of the website restorecord.com and the [private] of the code in [private] repository.

The claimant has already acknowledged that [private] created the source code and sold him a copy, and just because he's in the possession of the source code does not give him the right to make copyright claims against its creator. He was not given any copyright ownership https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/07/2022-07-05-restorecord.md

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/wnelson03/RestoreCord-Source-Code

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The same claimant has made repeated fraudulent DMCA notices to the same repository, which have all been appealed and overruled.
Yet, GitHub continues to allow the exact same person to copyright claim the EXACT same repository 3 times in a row. This is a violation of copyright protection and makes GitHub liable.

I request the individual/copyright claimant's contact details as I will need to elevate this to a legal dispute in a court of law.

Additionally, the copyright claim is about TWO different works, making it invalid. The claimant claimed [private] repository "wnelson03", which has code authored by [private] in [private]. Then, the claimant also listed a different link from the user "[private]", which has a completely different code base, even written in a different programming language. My project is in C# and PHP programming, the other project is in JavaScript. As such, this claim should be reversed as the claimant attempted to claim both my work and the work of someone else that doesn't relate to my repository, yet a different repository listed in the notice.

This demonstrates a clear lack of understanding for copyright law by the claimant. As well as illegal malice.

The DMCA takedown is not legitimate and I look forward to seeing my copyighted work going back online on GitHub

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
