**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the software authentication website KeyAuth. I retain all copyright ownership over my works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am claiming the entire repositories (https://github.com/cvlabsio/EmuAuth, https://github.com/sys064/Keyauth-Emulator2, https://github.com/CE-X/EmuAuth, https://github.com/yerrroo/Emu) all files infringe upon [private] work, I simply am giving a few examples for the sake of brevity, anyone who reviews the infringing repository and my repository will see it's blatant theft.

I confirm under perjury that [private] all the copyrights for all the code inside of https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library

This project violates my copyright by circumventing [private] software to commit software piracy.

Additionally, the project has stolen code https://github.com/cvlabsio/EmuAuth/blob/main/EmuAuth/EmuAuth/Source/Utils.cpp#L7-L13 from https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library/blob/a58402877432150ffe63d9542e79a612a85b23c5/auth.cpp#L153-L163 and https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library/blob/a58402877432150ffe63d9542e79a612a85b23c5/auth.cpp#L59

More details on the circumvention below.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] implemented encryption and SSL certificate pinning as technological measures for my software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project instructs people to impersonate KeyAuth's domain name and make a fraudulent SSL certificate with our hostname. Then, they tell people to spoof DNS and intercept traffic without authorization to bypass technological measures

https://github.com/cvlabsio/EmuAuth?tab=readme-ov-file#step-2-run-the-emulator

The project says "Starting fake auth server" as they are impersonating KeyAuth and attempting to hijack traffic and circumvent the software https://github.com/cvlabsio/EmuAuth/blob/main/EmuAuth/EmuAuth/Source/Entry.cpp#L16

Also instructs users to inject into our software, similar to video-game hacking to exfiltrate secret keys for use with software piracy, accessing the program without authorization/consent https://github.com/cvlabsio/EmuAuth/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L14

Then the project returns fake data to circumvent the Software login https://github.com/cvlabsio/EmuAuth/blob/main/EmuAuth/EmuAuth/Source/Handler.cpp#L46-L63

Given the clear intention to "bypass keyauth" as the project author published themselves, this illegal material needs to be removed from GitHub expeditiously pursuant to copyright law.
