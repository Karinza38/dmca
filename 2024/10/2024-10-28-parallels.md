Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

All parallels products are large complex systems, to avoid excessive and wasteful memory use we tend to choose dynamic libraries over static linking.
As production and maintenance of a group of large very complex software systems, we prefer that people pay to use our products. To help encourage that payment we have numerous functions that are spread out across the software platform. As mentioned above rather than have each process load every function or method, some of the license verification code is located in dynamic libraries.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

We have numerous code sections to detect both license validity and executable file integrity detection. The utilities supplied by thesse reops uses code hooking to evade our attempt to stop this. The readme.md file clearly states that the code is to crack our products license protection.
