**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

I've sent an DMCA application at 2024.07.11.Here's the ticket ID:[private].

After that application, his repository was deleted,but shortly after the deletion, he recreated the same name repository and annotated it to another code-hosting site in readme.

Although there is no code in the github repository, the website in the readme that leads users to click violates my rights.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The repository's URL：[private]: [private] (github.com)

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I haven't found any forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

[This section is the same as in the previous application.]

Part of the code of this work comes from the Apcahe 2.0 open source project.

Here's the project: https://github.com/lvhaoxuan2015/NewCustomCuiLianPro

The allegedly infringing file also open-sourced all [private] code parts, without [private] authorization, infringing on [private] rights and interests

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal is the only option，if you can request a ban on the account, is a loophole.This person is exposing [private] commercial code to the public.

No
