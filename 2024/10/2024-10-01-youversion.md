GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read through GitHub's DMCA help doc. The content listed on https://youversion-dl.github.io/ basically infringes YouVersion IP and security measures.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This repository -- Bible MultiConverter posted in repo directing readers to a process for decrypting YouVersion texts. I thought I should highlight this to the team there.  
https://youversion-dl.github.io/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our approach to Bible access protection is to make it reasonably difficult to get personal access to our Bible text. This varies per platform.
On the web:  
We serve our chapters to the website using un-obfuscated HTML and CSS. The hope is that the barrier of web-scrapping is enough in this case to prevent people from downloading and using our content off of our platform.  
On iOS (Offline Usage):  
We send a zip of the Bible where each HTML chapter is lightly obfuscated in a deterministic way. From what I have seen, this is what is being used.
On Android:  
We send a protobuf binary format of our Bible which isn’t obfuscated, but is also reasonably harder than scrapping the web for it.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Step 1: Download .yves ZIP file  
YouVersion Bibles are DRM-protected .yves ZIP files. Can be downloaded in this step. You can also download JSON metadata. Bible name and bible book names only in metadata. Not included in .yves ZIP file.

Step 2: Remove DRM from .yves ZIP file  
Upload .yves ZIP file. Get ZIP file with .html fragments.

Step 3: Convert HTML fragments to USX3  
Upload HTML Fragments ZIP file. Maybe also JSON metadata. Get USX3 ZIP file.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No contact information listed

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
