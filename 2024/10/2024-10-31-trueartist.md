**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the code in question, which [private] developed and maintain in [private], [private]. I did not authorize the contractor or any third party to publish or distribute this code publicly. The developer, hired as a contractor, was given temporary access solely for development purposes, under the understanding that the code would remain private and proprietary. Therefore, I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner in requesting the takedown of this unauthorized public release.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work, titled '[private]' is a proprietary frontend codebase for the 'TrueArtist' project, developed entirely in [private] at [private]. This repository contains custom frontend components, styling, and functionality exclusive to my project. The code includes unique designs, proprietary logic, and implementation specific to 'TrueArtist' that were developed and copyrighted solely by me or under my direction. The infringing code is a direct copy of this proprietary work.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository containing the infringing code should be taken down, as it consists entirely of unauthorized copies of my original work. The infringing repository can be found here: https://github.com/gentleman9999/TrueArtist-Frontend.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have initiated searches for forks or copies of the infringing repository on GitHub. However, it is challenging to identify all potential clones or forks, particularly if they were made prior to the takedown request. I request assistance from GitHub in identifying any forks or mirrors of https://github.com/gentleman9999/TrueArtist-Frontend and any repositories that have cloned or retained a copy of the original repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

I do not have their contact information

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
