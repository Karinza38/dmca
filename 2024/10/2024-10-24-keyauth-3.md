GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the software authentication website KeyAuth. I retain all copyright ownership over [private] works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am claiming the entire repository https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher all files infringe upon [private] work, I simply am giving a few examples for the sake of brevity, anyone who reviews the infringing repository and [private] repository will see it's blatant theft.

I confirm under perjury that I own all the copyrights for all the code inside of https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example

This repository violates my copyright by circumventing [private] program. As clearly evidenced below, this is a "keyauth bypass" to technological protections, which makes this illegal due to the anti-circumvention clause of DMCA law.

https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher/blob/c68a902a63e5b8d3963d7a2854ae3b940eaadc8c/Patcher/obj/Release/Patcher.csproj.FileListAbsolute.txt#L1C41-L1C55
https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher/blob/c68a902a63e5b8d3963d7a2854ae3b940eaadc8c/Patcher/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs#L6

More information on the circumvention below in the other fields of this legal complaint.

Additionally, this code https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher/blob/main/Patcher/Classes/Patch.cs#L40-L49 was stolen from [private] original work https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/main/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L1141-L1150

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] implemented encryption and SSL certificate pinning as technological measures for [private] software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project author admits to this circumventing authentication by "swapping strings" which circumvents protection checks https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L7C129-L7C183

The project uses HarmonyPatch to circumvent cryptographic signature checksum. https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher/blob/main/Patcher/Classes/NVC.cs#L27-L38 this error message "Signature checksum failed" is seen in [private] original work https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/4080f71b65c200e14fd82cb284b0119bdcf1ee02/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L1038  
The project is also seen here spoofing authentication information to defeat technological measures https://github.com/BinaryFemboys/Harmony-Patcher/blob/main/Patcher/Classes/Patch.cs#L135-L146 these "ownerid" and "secret" names come from [private] code https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/4080f71b65c200e14fd82cb284b0119bdcf1ee02/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L32

Given the clear intention to "bypass keyauth" as the project author published themselves, this illegal material needs to be removed from GitHub expeditiously pursuant to copyright law.

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
