**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Gnu GPLv2

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Hello,

I am writing to request assistance with ensuring that several forks of my project, Obscreen, hosted on GitHub are fully compliant with the necessary legal and project guidelines.

While these forks may technically be licensed under GPL v2, I have identified a few concerns that need to be addressed to avoid confusion or non-compliance with the project's broader guidelines:

1. Use of the Project Name and Branding: Some forks continue to use the exact name and branding of Obscreen (https://www.obscreen.io) which may cause confusion about the relationship between the forks and the original project. Although the GPL v2 governs the code, the use of the project’s name or branding should be modified to avoid potential misunderstandings about the source or ownership of the software.

2. Non-Code Elements: Some forks may include non-code elements that are not covered by the GPL v2 license, such as logos, documentation, or other media specific to the original project. These elements should not be reused without proper permission or should be removed to maintain the project's intellectual property rights.

3.Full Compliance with GPL v2 Distribution Requirements: Although the forks are under GPL v2, it appears that some have failed to include essential files such as the full license text, proper copyright notices, or acknowledgments required by the GPL v2. These must be included to ensure full compliance with the terms of the license.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

- Rename their projects to avoid confusion with the original project.  
- Remove any non-code elements that are not licensed under GPL v2.  
- Ensure that they include all required licensing files and copyright notices.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
