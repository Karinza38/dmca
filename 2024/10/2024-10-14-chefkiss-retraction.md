Subject: DMCA Retraction Notice

Dear GitHub Team,  
I am writing to formally retract the DMCA Takedown Notice submitted on 09-10-2024 regarding the Repository located at https://github.com/alvindimas05/AMDHelper. The original DMCA Takedown Notice was submitted to GitHub and claimed that the Repository Contents infringed on my Copyright.

After communication with the Repository Owner, the Repository Contents were modified in a way that no longer infringes my Copyright, and wish to retract my previously-submitted DMCA Takedown Notice. I understand that this DMCA Takedown Retraction Notice will allow the Repository to be restored.

Please confirm the receipt of this DMCA Takedown Retraction Notice and the restoration of the Repository at your earliest convenience.  
Thank you for your attention to this matter.  
Sincerely,  
[private] (private!) (pseudoname: “[private]”).  
[private] of the GitHub Organisation “ChefKissInc” (ChefKiss).
