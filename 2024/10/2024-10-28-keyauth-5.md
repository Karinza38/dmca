**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

No

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the software authentication website KeyAuth. I retain all copyright ownership over [private] works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am claiming the entire repository https://github.com/exampledocs/cdn all files infringe upon my work.

My code is being used in violation of my Copyright license license for commercial use on [private]. This is a complete violation of my legal rights. The Elastic License states "You may not provide the software to third parties as a hosted or managed" and all my projects stolen by the infringing URL are licensed under Elastic License 2.0.

The [private] to every single ZIP file is: [private]  
This is because the project owner has a history of infringing my copyright and is trying to evade copyright law. I have pending DMCA complaints for [invalid] and li which prove repeated previous infringement by the GitHub project user. GitHub must follow the DMCA copyright law and take the time to investigate my legal claims, which under perjury I attest are valid.

Let's start with "CPP.zip". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

[private] to [private], we see it's the exact same Microsoft Visual Studio "ProjectGuid" of [private].

This means the code theft was so sloppily done, they actually used my same project file and didn't even bother putting my stolen code into a separate folder. The Microsoft project GUID is unique, this confirms the entire project is stolen [private]

Same thing with [private] compared to https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/x64/example.sln, every single UNIQUE guid identifier is the EXACT same as [private] copyrighted project.

[private] is clearly stolen also from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/x64/main.cpp. Notice the "[private]", "s[private]", and "[private]" functions stolen. The "[private]" stolen from "KeyAuthApp", and "[private]", and "[private]"

[private] is also stolen, identical to https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/x64/utils.hpp

And [private] is nearly identical to https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/x64/auth.hpp, same strings and structures stolen from my code.

This repeats itself in the other folders, though I can't make this legal complaint too long.

Now let's take a look at "[private]". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

Look at the file [private], the Unique Microsoft "ProjectGuid" is yet again stolen exactly from my project. [private] same as [private]

[private] is blatantly stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/main/Console/Program.cs same "[private]" as "[private]", "[private]" and the functions "[private]", "[private]", and "[private]" all a direct match to my copyrighted code.

[private] to https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/main/Console/KeyAuth.cs and you find an exact match, giving clear evidence the code is stolen.

This repeats itself in the other folders, though I can't make this legal complaint too long.

Now let's take a look at "[private]". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

[private], with the code exactly matching my functions [private], [private], and [private].

Also the [private] and other obvious theft such as [private] being stolen from my project.

Comparing [private] to https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example/blob/main/keyauth.py is also an exact match, proving more code theft of my copyrighted work.

Now let's take a look at "[private]". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

Look at the file[private], the Unique Microsoft "ProjectGuid" is yet again stolen exactly from my project. [private] same as [private]

Comparing [private] we see nearly all code is stolen from my project. Same structures, exact same code for [private] and more functions. https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-VB-Example/blob/main/KeyAuth.vb#L58-L396

Now let's take a look at "[private]". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

All the Javascript code is stolen from [private] I confirm under perjury that I own all the copyrights for all the code inside of [private]

[private] ( Default )\index.js is stolen from [private]. The function Dashboard() is an exact match, also the "[private]", "[private]", and "[private]" are all clearly stolen from my project.

[private] is stolen from [invalid] exactly, exact same code and even code comments.

[private] [private] is also stolen from [private], same function [private] and [private]", "[private]", and "[private]" are all clearly stolen from my project.

[private] is stolen from [private] exactly, exact same code and even code comments.

Now let's take a look at "[private]". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

Lines 10-14 of [private] are stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-PHP-Example/blob/main/index.php#L18-L22

Lines 237-267 of [private] are stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-PHP-Example/blob/main/index.php#L157-L187

[private] is entirely stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-PHP-Example/blob/main/keyauth.php

Now let's take a look at "[private]". We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

[private] is stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Go-Example/blob/main/main.go the [private], [private], "[private]", "[private]", and "[private]. Also all the class and variable names [private], [private], and [private].

[private] is entirely stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Go-Example/blob/main/KeyAuth/KeyAuth.go

Now let's take a look at "[private]. We will unzip the archive file using [private] "[private]".

All the Javascript code is stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth-Archive/KeyAuth-JAVA-api I confirm under perjury that I own all the copyrights for all the code inside of https://github.com/KeyAuth-Archive/KeyAuth-JAVA-api

[private] is stolen entirely from https://github.com/KeyAuth-Archive/KeyAuth-JAVA-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/spray/keyauth/Application.java

[private] is stolen completely from https://github.com/KeyAuth-Archive/KeyAuth-JAVA-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/spray/keyauth/user/UserData.java

[private] is stolen entirely from https://github.com/KeyAuth-Archive/KeyAuth-JAVA-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/spray/keyauth/util/HWID.java

[private]is fully stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth-Archive/KeyAuth-JAVA-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/spray/keyauth/api/KeyAuth.java

Given the fact I've proven beyond a reasonable doubt, that the project owner has stolen all of my code and is attempting to profit from it with their website [private], this illegal project needs to be removed from GitHub expeditiously pursuant to DMCA copyright law.
