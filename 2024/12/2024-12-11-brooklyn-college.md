[private] a [private] at the [private] at Brooklyn College of the City University of [private]. A couple of students in a class that [private] been [private] for the last few years posted homework assignment instructions and answers to several of the homework assignments that [private] assigned to that class in several GitHub repositories.

[private] the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the instructions of the homework assignments that were posted in these repositories and never gave permission to any student in any of [private] classes to post any homework instructions that [private] [private] nor the solutions that they wrote to these assignments anywhere on the Internet.

To be precise, posting assignments or works to a website is prohibited by the City University of [private] integrity policy, which you may find here: https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/.  
Below is a direct quote from the policy: "Definitions and Examples of Academic Dishonesty. Cheating is the unauthorized use or attempted use of material, information, notes, study aids, devices, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, or communication during an academic exercise. Example of cheating include: Copying from another person or from a generative AI system or allowing others to copy work submitted for credit or a grade. This includes **uploading work or submitting class assignments or exams to third party platforms and websites beyond those assigned for the class, such as commercial homework aggregators, without the proper authorization of a professor**."

Clearly, GitHub belongs to the category of "third party platforms and websites", and [private] never assigned [private] students to use GitHub for their assignments and never provided any permission to upload neither homework instructions nor solutions on GitHub (whether these are solutions [private] providing to [private] students or solutions that [private] students wrote and submitted.)

Besides this GitHub repository violating my copyrights and [private] university's integrity policy, it also lets students who will take the subject with me this Spring 2025 semester and beyond cheat since the solutions to the assignments are publically accessible to all. The subject is [private], [private]. It is my true belief that GitHub wants anything but to encourage students to cheat on assignments and infringe on their instructor's copyrights.

I demand that GitHub either take down these repositories or turn them into private repositories that will be visible to and accessible only to the students who created them.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

1. Includes the solutions to two of the homework assignments, HW #2 and HW #3, of [private]. This repository violates the City University of [private] Integrity Policy, as [private] never gave permission to any of [private] students to post their works for [private] class online:   
[invalid]  
2. Includes the solutions to a homework assignment, HW #2, of [private]. This repository violates the City University of [private] Integrity Policy, as [private] never gave permission to any of [private] students to post their works for [private] class online:  
[invalid]  
3. Includes the solutions to a homework assignment, HW #3, of [private]. This repository violates the City University of [private] Integrity Policy, as [private] never gave permission to any of [private] students to post their works for [private] class online:  
[invalid]  
4. Includes the solutions to a homework assignment, HW #4, of [private]. This repository violates the City University of [private] Integrity Policy, as [private] never gave permission to any of [private] students to post their works for my class online:  
[invalid]  
5. Includes both the homework instructions written by [private] and solutions to a homework assignment, HW #5, of [private]. This repository not only violates the City University of [private] Integrity Policy, as [private] never gave permission to any of [private] students to post their works for [private] class online, but also [private] [private] copyrights, as I explain below.  
https://github.com/pappus-peter/cisc3350_hw5  
This repository includes a copy of the homework instructions that [private] for the class and, therefore, are [private] original copyrighted work. This homework instructions are located in the file at https://github.com/pappus-peter/cisc3350_hw5/blob/main/my_grep.c.  
As part of this assignment, [private] provided my students with the "my_grep.c" C source code file with just a few missing code lines: the task was to fill in those missing lines to make the program work according to the comments [private] placed throughout the file. This means that the majority of the content of this file, including the vast majority of code and all the comments, were written by [private], while only a minor number of lines were written by the students. The presence of the file "my_grep.c" in a public GitHub repository infringes [private] [private] copyrights!  
To prove that this file was indeed written by [private], the following is a link the my_grep.c file on [private] [private] website, which has [private] [private] domain: [private]  
After the semester when the student who posted this repository took the class, [private] made a few changes to the comments across the file, but the code remained the same, meaning that the my_grep.c file in the GitHub repository continues infringing my copyrights.

6. Includes both the homework instructions written by [private] and solutions to a homework assignment, HW #6, of [private]. Again, this repository not only violates the City University of [private] Integrity Policy, as [private] never gave permission to any of [private] students to post their works for [private] class online, but also [private] [private] copyrights, as I explain below.  
https://github.com/pappus-peter/cisc3350_hw6  
As part of this assignment, [private] provided [private] students with the "resistant.c" C source code file with just a few missing code lines: the task was to fill in those missing lines to make the program work according to the comments [private] placed throughout the file. This means that the majority of the content of this file, including the vast majority of code and all the comments, were written by [private], while only a minor number of lines were written by the students. The presence of the file "resistant.c" in a public GitHub repository infringes [private] [private] copyrights!
To prove that this file was indeed written by [private], the following is a link the my_grep.c file on [private] [private] website, which has [private] [private] domain: [private]  
After the semester when the student who posted this repository took the class, [private] made a few changes to the comments across the file, but the code remained the same, meaning that the resistant.c file in the GitHub repository continues infringing my copyrights.

Please note that the original my_grep.c and resistant.c (before the changes that [private] to the comments in that file) are still stored on [private] [private] and have a modification timestamp the precedes the student's addition of these files to the GitHub repositories. Unfortunately, this takedown form doesn't allow me to upload files, but, if you request, I will be more than glad to send you screenshot(s) of [private] [private] showing these original files and their timestamps.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repositoryâ€™s URL.**

The following entire repositories:  
1. [invalid]  
2. [invalid]  
3. [invalid]  
4. [invalid]  
5. [invalid]  
6. [invalid]

2. https://github.com/pappus-peter/cisc3350_hw6/blob/main/resistant.c
