I am the [private] and [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This concerns a Minecraft mod called AutoTotem-Fabric, which [private] originally created and published in [private] repository:
https://github.com/Qetrox/AutoTotem-Fabric

What has been stolen:  
Another user has almost completely copied [private] original code, but has:  
- Renamed the files.  
- Modified the mod's internal information (such as the owner/author details) to present themselves as the creator.  
- Removed a single file and made minor changes to the code (such as removing functions and configuration options).

Why this is still infringement:  
The codebase and structure of the project are nearly identical to [private] original work, despite the small modifications. These changes (such as removing functions) do not alter the fact that the majority of the code originates from [private] work.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/VanyaKereng/ultimate-autototem  
The files in this repository have been renamed and slightly modified, but the core code and structure remain identical to [private] original project.
