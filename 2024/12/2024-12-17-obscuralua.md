Dear GitHub Support,  
  
[private] the [private] and [private] of ObscuraLua, a Lua obfuscator service offering advanced script security through proprietary encryption and obfuscation techniques. The copyrighted work includes the following:  
  
Proprietary algorithms specifically developed for script obfuscation and encryption.  
  
Distinct obfuscation logic and unique file structures.  
  
Metadata and file headers that identify the obfuscated outputs as generated by ObscuraLua.  
  
These elements are integrated into ObscuraLua software, which is only accessible to authorized users via our official platform: https://obscuralua.com.  
  
The infringing repositories host unauthorized distributions of our proprietary obfuscation system. Specifically:  
  
ObscuraLua-encrypted files: The files in these repositories exhibit distinctive features that match the proprietary outputs of ObscuraLua's obfuscation process, including specific patterns, encryption markers, and structures.  
  
Unauthorized reproduction of source code: Portions of our proprietary algorithms and logic, which are not publicly available, are directly included or replicated in these repositories.  
  
Illegitimate use of file headers and metadata: The files contain identifiable markers that indicate unauthorized access and use of ObscuraLua's obfuscator.  
  
These repositories not only contain unauthorized copies of ObscuraLua's outputs but are also being used to facilitate unauthorized access to our obfuscator, bypassing legitimate licensing mechanisms.

[private] the [private] and [private] of ObscuraLua, a Lua obfuscator service. ObscuraLua's proprietary software code and related documentation are protected under copyright law. I have the authority to act on behalf of ObscuraLua in all copyright-related matters. Unauthorized distribution, use, and modification of our obfuscator, which involves significant proprietary code, constitute direct copyright infringement.

Dear GitHub Support,  
  
[private] the [private] and [private] of ObscuraLua, a Lua obfuscator service that provides advanced security features for Lua scripts. The copyrighted work includes proprietary algorithms, obfuscation methods, and source code uniquely designed by our company. These elements are integrated into the ObscuraLua software, which has not been licensed for public distribution or modification.  
  
The infringing repositories host unauthorized distributions of our proprietary ObscuraLua obfuscator, version 1.1.0, which contains significant portions of our protected source code. These repositories reproduce and distribute this code without authorization, violating our intellectual property rights.  
  
The infringed material is identifiable by the presence of our distinct obfuscation logic, algorithmic structures, and file headers, which match the proprietary structures found in our source code. These elements are not publicly available, making their inclusion in the infringing repositories clear evidence of unauthorized use.  
  
The original ObscuraLua software and documentation are not publicly accessible to protect against unauthorized use. However, authorized access to our platform and features is available through our official website: https://obscuralua.com.
