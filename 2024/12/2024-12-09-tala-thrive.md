Hi,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am writing to formally request the removal of
the following repository, which contains unauthorized copies of proprietary code owned by our company:

â€¢ **Repository URL**: https://github.com/dreamworksTest/TalaThriveReactJsCode

The content hosted in this repository includes source code and intellectual property developed for Tala Thrive. This
specific code was written for our earlier version of the Tala Thrive platform using React.js when the development
was done on a contractual basis by the development firm Dreamworks which this repository clearly belongs to. It is
not intended for public distribution as it is proprietary to Tala Thrive.The repository owner has no right to host,
distribute or share the copyrighted content publicly or otherwise and should remove the code from the repository
and delete all copies of said codebase.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not
authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright
owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed
