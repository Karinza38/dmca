Dear GitHub Copyright Agent(s),

I am submitting this Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice regarding unauthorized content uploaded to GitHub. This content infringes on [private] copyrighted work—a Minecraft mod [private] developed as part of a commission. Payment for the work was revoked by the client, and the material has been uploaded without [private] consent.

**Statement of Understanding**  
I have read and understand GitHub’s guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.



**Identification of the Copyrighted Work**  
The infringed work consists of custom code developed by [private] as part of the commissioned mod. Below is a grouped description of the infringed files:

**1. Core Utility Classes:**  
- `AbstractModMenu.class` and `AbstractModMenu.java`  
- `AddedPlayerInventories.java`  
- `ModResultSlot.java`

**2. Custom Block Functionality (Witches Cauldron):**  
- `WitchesCauldron.class` and `WitchesCauldron.java`  
- `WitchesCauldronBlockEntity.java`  
- `WitchesCauldronRecipe.java` and `WitchesCauldronRecipeBuilder.java`  
- `WitchesCauldronCategory.java`  

**3. Custom Block Functionality (Witches Oven):**  
- `WitchesOven.java`  
- `WitchesOvenBlockEntity.java`  
- `WitchesOvenMenu.java` and `WitchesOvenScreen.java`  
- `WitchesOvenCategory.java`  
- `WitchesOvenRecipe.java` and `WitchesOvenRecipeBuilder.java`

**4. Miscellaneous:**  
- `ITickableBlockEntity.java` (tutorial-based code with no copyright claim by [private]).  
- `ModForgeEvents.java` (original with some external methods).


These files, either created or significantly modified by [private], constitute [private] original work. They are hosted without [private] authorization in the following repository:



**Identification of the Infringing Material (Repository)**  
https://github.com/MasterQuentus/Hexcraft-1.20



**Remedy to Resolve the Infringement**  
To remedy this infringement, the infringer must:  
1. Remove the repository and any associated files containing [private] copyrighted materials from GitHub immediately or;   
2. Revoke their [private] dispute and pay the outstanding balance of $160.51 USD, which includes:   

- $145.51 USD representing the payment originally credited to [private] after [private] processing fees, now reversed.   
- $15 USD for the fee [private] charged me for the dispute.

Failure to comply with either condition will result in further legal action to protect [private] rights and intellectual property. 

**Details of Infringement / Acknowledgment of Fair Use**

The infringer uploaded these files, including `.class` files (compiled versions of [private] `.java` source code), which are [private] intellectual property. Portions of boilerplate code or public tutorials do not diminish the originality of the overall implementation.



**Evidence of Ownership**

I provide the following evidence to demonstrate [private] authorship:

- Communication Logs:  
Chat logs from [private] and [private] showing commission terms, discussions of functionality, payment agreements, and delivery of the mod. 

- Local File Timestamps:  
Files showing the “last modified” date predating the infringer’s uploads.

- Transactional Records:  
[private] records showing partial payments and the client’s revocation of payment. 

- Alias Confirmation:  
[private] use of aliases ([private], [private], and [private]…?) across [private], [private], and GitHub, as evidenced in chat logs and metadata.

A detailed zip file containing these materials is attached for review. 



**Good Faith Statement**

I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material in the manner complained of is not authorized by me, the copyright owner, my agent, or the law. 



**Sworn Statement**

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and that I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
