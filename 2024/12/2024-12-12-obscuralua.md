Dear GitHub Support,

I am writing to request the removal of unauthorized content hosted on GitHub that infringes on ObscuraLua's copyrights. Specifically, the infringing repository contains a direct upload of the source code for ObscuraLua v1, proprietary software developed exclusively by ObscuraLua LLC. This source code is protected under copyright law and has not been publicly distributed or licensed for use or sharing.

The uploaded source code includes the following:

Exact copies of proprietary algorithms and code logic: These are uniquely developed and owned by ObscuraLua.

Distinct file headers and metadata: Identifiable markers in the source code explicitly link this work to ObscuraLua.

Unauthorized reproduction of our proprietary system: The repository contains verbatim copies of ObscuraLua v1’s proprietary obfuscation engine and related files.

The original ObscuraLua software and code are securely hosted and accessed only via authorized channels. They have never been made public. You can reference our official website for proof of ownership and authorized access details: https://obscuralua.com.

Additional Information  
The repository in question directly infringes on ObscuraLua’s intellectual property by reproducing its source code in its entirety. This action not only violates copyright law but also undermines the integrity of our business. Immediate removal is requested to prevent further unauthorized access and distribution of this content.
