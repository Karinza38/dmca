**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private]. I am a [private] in the Broadband Video Group (BVG) at Broadcom. My sub-group creates the SDK’s for our DSL, PON, and Wifi gateways and routers. One of my responsibilities is to [private] issues for our SDK.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Broadcom only releases our SDK to companies who have signed a Software License Agreement (SLA) and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with us. The SDK is not available to anyone or any company who has not signed a SLA+NDA with Broadcom. Our license strictly protects our code and does not allow the posting of our code on public locations such as Github.

I have studied weihutsui’s Github repo, and it is clear by the unique version numbering ([private]), directory structure, and files that this person somehow obtained our SDK and uploaded it to his Github repo (“BCM”).

If this person was an employee of a company that signed a SLA+NDA with Broadcom, he is not allowed to post our code on Github. If this person was not an employee of a company that signed a SLA+NDA with Broadcom, then he is not allowed to have this SDK in the first place and definitely is not allowed to post it on Github.

Weihutsui’s BCM repo on GitHub was initially uploaded on March 18, 2018. On the next day, he made 8 more commits, all of which had a changelog of “test” and appears to be simply adding more files from the Broadcom SDK into the repo. There have been no other commits since this initial batch on March 18-19, 2018. This person does not appear to have added any code, content, or enhancements of his own to this repo.

Since this BCM repo appears to contain only files from the Broadcom SDK, and no other non-Broadcom code/content/enhancements were added to it, we are requesting that the entire repo be deleted/taken down. I have looked at the 21 forks of this BCM repo and they are all just the initial fork from the master with no other commits. Therefore we are requesting that the other 21 forks be deleted/taken down as well.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We request that the entire repo be taken down. https://github.com/weihutaisui/BCM

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. I have looked at all the 21 forks, and all of them are just the initial fork from the master. They do not have any other commits. We are requesting they all be taken down.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

I see an email address on the infringer's github home page ([private]), but I have not tried to contact him yet because I wanted to make sure this repo's commit and forking information stays intact while I am discussing this take down action with Github.
