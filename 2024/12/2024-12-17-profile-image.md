**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

Yes

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

Both

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I tried to talk to the [“developer” SrGobi on Github](https://github.com/SrGobi) who brags that it is his code but he doesn't seem to get anywhere, not even to leave credits at least respecting the former MIT license

After talking to him, he refused to even give credit, claiming that his code was made with GPT/Copilot and referenced, when obviously he did not, considering that even the file names were copied.

At the time of copying, my project had an MIT license; which it did not comply with by not giving credit/coyright notice.

Extra and new Info:  
A github account [private] (Obviously a SrGobi multi-account) that has given a star to all the repos of SrGobi (the plagiarizer) comes to give [private] a PR saying that his is the official one (feat: official repository by [private] · Pull Request #23 · iAsure/discord-arts (github.com))

I find this unacceptable from SrGobi, he keeps refusing to talk, even blocking/banning me avoiding communication and now using multiple accounts to do this

Users like this in Github are not healthy at all

> I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notification.

I attach complete files as these are modified and parsed copies, the subject in question admitted to have used AI to not look like a copy, it is only a question of seeing the final results (README.md) and the similarity in the code to discover that it is a copy

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

His theft is not a fork, if it was at least it would have some credit but no.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT when it was plagiarized, I actually passed it to UNLICENSED

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

License conditions were not met (MIT), the user refuses to give credit claiming it is his code

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Adding attribution

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
