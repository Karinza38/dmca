**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Febucci S.R.L. is the [private] and [private] of the package/plugin called "Text Animator for Unit" ([private]). I am acting on behalf of the legal representative.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Text Animator for Unity is a code tool/plugin that allows developers to "bring their texts to life" using the Unity Engine: https://www.febucci.com/text-animator-unity/

It's a set of algorithms and files ("ScriptableObjects", example scenes and more) that allows users to animate the text in their projects using Unity, showing letters one after another, create custom effects (in the inspector or via code), make things happen when some letters are shown and more.

The package is out since 2020 in the Unity Asset Store and is available only to people who purchased it, store page:  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/text-animator-for-unity-254677

It is not available for free/publicly, and it's regulated by the Unity Asset Store license:  
- https://unity.com/legal/as-terms  
- https://assetstore.unity.com/browse/eula-faq

This repository contains the full source code of Text Animator for Unity, visibile/accessible to anyone. Since the asset cannot be distributed, we're asking the user to mark their repository as private (so that they can keep "saving" it and collaborate with other people that own a license in their team), or if they need to have a public repository: to remove the asset from source control (recursively) and never include such assets again (modifying their .gitignore properly).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
