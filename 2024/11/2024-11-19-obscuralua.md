Dear GitHub Support,

I am submitting this DMCA takedown request to report copyright infringement on GitHub involving [private] original work, ObscuraLua. Unauthorized repositories have been identified on your platform that contain unlicensed copies of our proprietary Lua obfuscator software. These repositories appear to circumvent DMCA policies by substituting the term “ObscuraLua” with “Prometheus” within the code and associated documentation, creating the false impression that the code originates from a different source. Despite this superficial modification, the code and documentation remain substantially identical to our proprietary software.

The infringing content includes significant portions of our codebase, identifiable by matching sequences, structures, and functionality that correspond directly to ObscuraLua. Additionally, an unauthorized license has been applied to this code, which misrepresents our intellectual property and potentially misleads users regarding the origin and permissions associated with this software.

I request the removal of these infringing repositories in accordance with DMCA policy to protect our intellectual property rights on GitHub.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
