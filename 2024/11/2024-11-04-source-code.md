**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

Yes

**Which license?**

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

- The project omits the required GPL-3.0 license file and copyright notice, which is a violation of section 5(a) of the GPL.  
- The project has removed my watermark and copyright attribution, which violates section 7(b) of the GPL.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

- Add the correct GPL-3.0 license file to the project.  
- Restore my watermark and copyright attribution.  
- Alternatively, if the user does not wish to comply with the GPL-3.0 license, they should remove my code from their repository.
