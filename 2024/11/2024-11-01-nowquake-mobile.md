**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private]   and copyright owner of the code in question. [private]   created and published this code independently, and [private]   hold the exclusive rights to distribute, modify, and license it.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a software application named "NowQuake-Mobile," located at [private]. This repository contains code that [private] developed and own exclusively, and it is protected by copyright law.

The code includes unique functionality, algorithms, and sensitive information such as keys that are integral to the software’s operation. It was inadvertently set to public in April, after which it was immediately forked by another user without authorization, resulting in https://github.com/zhangxuanrui2023/NowQuake-Mobile.

This forked repository replicates my copyrighted work in its entirety, without any license or authorization provided, which I believe constitutes a copyright infringement.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Yes, I have searched for forks of my repository, and I have identified one specific fork that I believe infringes on my copyright. The infringing fork is located at https://github.com/zhangxuanrui2023/NowQuake-Mobile, and I request its removal.

No
