Under this policy, [private] hold the copyright to the code [private] created as part of [private] coursework, as it constitutes [private] original work developed independently.

If the reporter can provide proof that they own the source code [private] wrote, I will evaluate whether deletion or other action is appropriate. If copyright ownership is proven, I am willing to remove it.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The DMCA takedown led to the removal of [private] entire repository at this URL: https://github.com/jerrykhh/cityu/tree/main/cs2312. The repository included several files that reflect [private] original solutions to course assignments.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe the report was filed in error, and I’d like to address several points that support this belief:  
Original Content: The code provided in the repository is [private] original work, created independently to solve coursework assignments. The reporter's statement that “over 70% of the contents were provided by [private] and without any changes by the [private]” is incorrect; I ask that the reporter provide evidence to support their claim if they believe otherwise.

Commit History for Proof of Authorship: [private] an earlier [private] with the original source code, including commit history from around four years ago, located at [private]. This history clearly shows [private] [private] and the code’s originality. Since this code was posted years ago, I also question why the reporter is making this claim now.

Previous Email & Request Context: Prior to this DMCA, I received an email request from someone [private] this course, asking someone to remove the solutions from [private] GitHub but the name is not mine so I ignored it. However, this email did not include any assertion of copyright ownership over [private] code. From my understanding, this request may have been based on a desire to prevent students from copying solutions instead of creating their own work, rather than any legitimate copyright claim. It’s important to note that [private] code, is only [private] own solutions.

If the reporter can provide legitimate proof that they own the source code [private] wrote, I will evaluate whether deletion or other action is appropriate. If copyright ownership is proven, I am willing to remove it.

I am aware that the practice of buying and selling source code is widespread in the [private] community. Not everyone has the financial means to purchase these materials, yet students who do so can significantly boost their grades. This creates an unfair advantage over those who cannot afford to buy these resources. For this reason, [private] to make my own work and resources public in an effort to bring a bit more fairness to the situation.

While I know I cannot make the world completely fair, I want to ensure that I am not contributing to its unfairness. I believe learning should be about mutual sharing and collaboration, not a transaction where students buy solutions to earn higher grades without truly engaging with the knowledge. To address this issue effectively, I would suggest that the complainant consider regularly updating course materials and assignments. This would help prevent situations where certain students rely on past solutions to excel, rather than remove the course solution on the Internet and then solve the problem.

I believe this is the attitude educators should uphold. Teaching should foster genuine understanding and curiosity, creating an environment where students are encouraged to learn through their own efforts rather than relying on purchased solutions.

Thanks
