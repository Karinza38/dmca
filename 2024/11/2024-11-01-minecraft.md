To Whom It may concern:

We hereby notify you on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, (“Microsoft Corporation”) that the following URL https://github.com/RaveTek/Eaglercraft-1.21.1 (the “URL”) which you are hosting contains content (the “Infringing Content”) which infringes the copyright, intellectual property rights, goodwill and reputation of Microsoft Corporation, including the following copyright (the “MINECRAFT Copyright”) owned by Microsoft Corporation, found on Microsoft Corporation’s website at   https://www.minecraft.net/:  
Copyright: MINECRAFT

The URL’s Infringing Content constitutes an infringement of Microsoft Corporation’s intellectual property rights in the MINECRAFT Copyright. The Minecraft code is copyrighted under the United States and other copyright laws and is the property of Minecraft. This repository contains copyrighted Minecraft material that could include, but it not limited to skin packs, emulators... This damages the goodwill and reputation of Microsoft Corporation and causes consumer confusion as to whether the Infringing Content is authorized, endorsed, or sponsored by Microsoft Corporation when, in fact, it is not. Microsoft Corporation has an obligation to the public to police against any copyright infringing content which may cause marketplace confusion. Such actions by the URL dilute Microsoft Corporation’s MINECRAFT Copyright, harm its associated goodwill, and constitute, inter alia, a misappropriation and violation of the rights of Microsoft Corporation. This damage to its business entitles Microsoft Corporation to various forms of relief, including monetary compensation.

We represent under penalty of perjury that the information in this notice is true and correct, and that we are authorized to act on behalf of Microsoft Corporation as owner of the MINECRAFT Copyright. We have a good faith belief that this use of the Infringing Content in the URL is not authorized by Microsoft Corporation as the owner of the MINECRAFT Copyright or its agents, nor is such use permissible by law. Use of such Infringing Content in the URL is not defensible. We have notified the registrant and registrar of the URL’s domain in writing of this matter.

Since you are hosting the URL containing the Infringing Content, we request that you immediately disable or suspend such URL without delay. We would appreciate your resolving this matter as soon as possible and confirming that you have done so within the next seven (7) days. Microsoft Corporation reserves the right to take whatever action it considers appropriate to protect its rights and nothing contained in this Notice is intended to constitute a waiver of any of Microsoft Corporation’s legal rights or remedies, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.
