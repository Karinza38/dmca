Dear GitHub Legal Team,

This is a formal legal notice on behalf of SC MB MODELS SRL (“the Company”), the lawful owner and exclusive rights holder of the source code associated with the Bestinform platform. This source code, protected under copyright law, represents substantial intellectual property developed as part of an EU-funded initiative, amounting to a verifiable investment of 3 million EUR.

It has come to our attention that an unauthorized user under the handle StormRunner06106 has posted and publicly disclosed portions of the Bestinform source code on your platform at the following URL: https://github.com/StormRunner06106/bestinform. This code, which constitutes a core asset of the Company, was uploaded without authorization, in direct violation of both our intellectual property rights and GitHub’s terms of service, as well as international copyright laws.

The Bestinform platform, a European Online Travel Agency (OTA), is a legally registered entity under the European Union trademark and intellectual property offices. The code was developed under significant financial investment and remains proprietary to SC MB MODELS SRL. This unauthorized publication constitutes an infringement of our rights and could result in substantial damages, including competitive harm and reputational injury.

In view of the seriousness of this matter, we demand the following actions be taken immediately:

1.     Immediate Takedown of all repositories and files that contain any portion of the proprietary Bestinform source code;

2.     Disclosure of Information regarding the infringing user’s identity, actions, and access to our proprietary materials, to aid in any legal proceedings;

3.     Preventative Action to prevent further infringement by ensuring that GitHub’s platform is not misused by users to publish unauthorized or illegally obtained intellectual property.

Failure to comply with these demands will result in the Company initiating formal legal action against GitHub for intellectual property infringement, including the criminal concealment of illegally distributed content on your platform. This action is warranted by your platform's allowance of unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material without verification of content ownership, in violation of both international copyright statutes and European cyber property laws.

We urge GitHub to act expeditiously to remedy this situation, as further delay may amplify our claim for damages and necessitate escalation to European and international legal bodies to enforce our intellectual property rights.

Please confirm the receipt of this notice and provide written confirmation of your immediate compliance actions.

Sincerely,

[private]  
[private]  
SC MB MODELS SRL
