Dear Madam or Sir, 

 


unfortunately, we have discovered that the URL  
https://github.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean?tab=readme-ov-file#  
 offers an add-in for the Chrome browser, among others, which can be used to bypass our paywalls at  
www.spiegel.de and  
www.manager-magazin.de.  

 


Our websites can be found on an extensive “list of supported websites”, which is unacceptable. It is a tool that is used to promote copyright infringements.
 It is also illegal under competition law. We cannot tolerate this. 


 

We request that you terminate the offer and all forks immediately and take it offline:
