**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a designated DMCA agent acting on behalf of my client, [private], who has authorized me to submit this takedown notice to protect his copyright and privacy. My client holds the copyright to the content in question, and I have been specifically hired to ensure that his rights are upheld and any unauthorized use of his material is addressed promptly.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is an open-source Anti-Cheat mod for the Unity game Liar's Bar, which my client have developed and published under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. The mod includes source code, documentation, a detailed description of its features, and a banner image that my client have created specifically for this project.

The original work can be found at the following URL: https://github.com/tyzeron/LiarsAntiCheat  
My client has also released the mod here: [private]

The infringing work was created by a third party who altered the author name and re-uploaded the compiled version of my client's mod on GitHub, along with my client's original description and banner image, misrepresenting themselves as the creator of the work.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be taken down as it contains the modified compiled version of my client's Anti-Cheat mod, my client's original documentation, and my client's banner image. The compiled mod infringes on my client's copyright because it does not credit my client as the original creator, which is a requirement under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. Instead, the modified version falsely attributes authorship to the infringer.

The repository URL is: https://github.com/xeyz0r/Liar-s-Anti-Cheat

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The license is being violated in the following ways:

1. **Attribution**: The infringer removed my client's name as the original author and replaced it with their own, which violates the requirement for proper attribution as outlined in the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

2. **Modification and Redistribution**: While the license allows for modification and redistribution, it mandates that modified versions must also be distributed under the same license and retain the original credits. The infringer's actions of altering the author information and failing to appropriately attribute my client as the original creator contradict this stipulation.

3. **Misrepresentation**: By presenting the modified version as if it were authored by them, the infringer falsely claims authorship of my client's work, which is a form of misrepresentation and violates the ethical standards intended by open-source licensing.

These actions undermine the intentions of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 and infringe on my client's rights as the original creator of the mod.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, the infringer can make the following changes:

1. **Add Proper Attribution**: The infringer must include your original name as the author in the project files, documentation, and any relevant descriptions, ensuring that the original authorship is clear.

2. **Include the Original License**: The infringer must provide the full text of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 in the repository, typically in a file named `LICENSE` or similar. This ensures that anyone using the code is aware of the license terms.

3. **Documentation of Changes**: The infringer should document any changes made to the original code to inform users about what has been modified from your original version.

4. **Remove Misleading Claims**: The infringer must remove any claims that mislead users into thinking they are the original authors, as this misrepresents the source of the work. That includes claims inside the mod itself.

5. **Include the Modified Source Code**: The infringer must provide access to the complete modified source code in the repository. According to the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, if they distribute the modified version, they must also make the source code available under the same license.

By implementing these changes, the infringer can align their project with the requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

In addition to compliance with the license, for the modified version to be considered legitimate and beneficial, the following points should be taken into account:

**Notable Modifications**: The infringer should implement significant enhancements or features that improve the functionality of the mod or address specific issues. These modifications should aim to provide value to users and demonstrate that they have engaged deeply with the original code.

By making notable modifications, the infringer can present their work as a legitimate derivative of the original, rather than merely a rebranded version, fostering a more positive contribution to the community.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
