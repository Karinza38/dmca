**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Out entire copyright audio library has been converted to an /sbg format, and the entire library illegally distributed on GitHub. This would the equivalent of taking an entire music artist song library, converting it to mp3, and posting it all on GitHub. While portions of our software is open source, our entire creative library is not. You have already removed the source git at: [private] - HOWEVER, we were told to submit each form as a separate request.

Here is the fork that must also be removed: https://github.com/DariuszO/sbagen_idoser

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It is a copy of each every every one of our audio content, converted to another format, available across our sites at https://i-doser.com https://idosersoftware.com https://idoseraudio.com and we own the full copyright.
