TypeType is engaged in the development of fonts (i.e. software for creating digital typefaces) and is the creator and exclusive rights holder of the TT Norms font (the "Work") and its worldwide distributor.  
An authorized example of the Work can be found at https://typetype.org/fonts/tt-norms-pro/ In addition, the Work is distributed through leading distributor websites such as:

- myfonts.com (https://www.myfonts.com/collections/tt-norms-font-typetype )
 
The Work is currently being used on the https://jjsinsulation.com/ (the "Website"). The fact of using the Work on the Website is confirmed by means of [private] identifier application; And in the network page code as well. Screenshots are attached.
 
Unfortunately, there is no information in our records to confirm licensed use of the Work for use on this Website.
 
We have contacted the owner of the site at many corporate emails and have asked for confirmation of the font license information. And if the site owner does not have a license, we have offer to purchase the appropriate font license
 
As a result of the appeal, we did not receive a final response to resolve this issue from the contact persons-holders of the aforementioned domain.

I provide this notice in good faith and with a reasonable belief that the rights held by TypeType are being infringed.
