**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The content in [private] repository is entirely original and independently created by [private]. [private] did not copy, reuse, or derive any material from the claimant's proprietary content. The code, documentation, and all other elements were developed based on [private] knowledge, research, and creativity.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I firmly believe that [private] repository does not infringe on any copyrights owned by the claimant, as the code in question was developed independently and does not include any proprietary material from the claimant. Despite my multiple attempts to clarify the matter and multiple changes made to the repository, the takedown was still enforced.

- The repository never contained any infringing content owned by the claimant.  
- HTML links to external content had been removed months before the take-down (see email conversations with you).  
- The claim "The infringing repositories offer and/or make use of the MetaTrader 4/5 Manager APIs and selling hacked protocol..." is not correct.

I kindly request that [private] repository be reinstated promptly, as this takedown has caused unnecessary disruption to my work. Please let me know if further information is required.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,  
[private]
