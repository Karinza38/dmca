While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of KeyAuth.com, a software authentication service for computer programmers.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This project infringes upon my copyright and violates the anti-circumvention clause of the DMCA by releasing a program meant to circumvent [private] software, enabling people to commit piracy. I request immediate removal.

All files within https://github.com/CheatoOfficial/KeyAuth-Loader-Emulation violate my copyright and need to be removed. I am creating this notice for all files within the GitHub project.

The project owner discusses bypassing hardware-locking protection by means of spoofing https://github.com/CheatoOfficial/KeyAuth-Loader-Emulation/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L8

The project owner also recommends people bruteforce [private] software, another violation of anti-circumvention copyright laws https://github.com/CheatoOfficial/KeyAuth-Loader-Emulation/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L12

The file https://github.com/CheatoOfficial/KeyAuth-Loader-Emulation/blob/main/KeyAuth.cs is also stolen from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/7b30d998b75dcd44e983fa44fe8b18bf250a95de/Form/KeyAuth.cs

This violates my copyright license which is not open source, and states "You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license key functionality
in the software" which clearly, this project directly intents to violate.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
