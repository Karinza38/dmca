DMCA Takedown Notice

To Whom It May Concern,

On behalf of Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), we submit this DMCA takedown notice to formally request that GitHub disable the repository located at MCA takedown notice to formally request that GitHub disable the repository located at [https://github.com/OpenCraft-Studios/OpenCraft (the "URL"). This repository, as hosted on GitHub, includes content that infringes Microsoft’s copyright, trademarks, and intellectual property rights associated with Minecraft.

Nature of the Infringement  
The infringing repository identifies itself as a “roughly calculated clone of Minecraft” and is named "OpenCraft," which directly references Microsoft’s proprietary game, Minecraft. The repository replicates the look, functionality, and gameplay of Minecraft, reproducing elements that are unique to Minecraft’s copyrighted code and visual assets.

The repository README file and documentation include the following specific elements that contribute to the infringement:

This creates an association with the Minecraft brand, potentially confusing consumers who may believe this project is affiliated withMinecraft” to describe the project, including statements such as "A roughly calculated clone of Minecraft."

Use of Minecraft's Trademarks and Branding: The README file repeatedly uses the term “Minecraft” to describe the project, including statements such as "A roughly calculated clone of Minecraft." This creates an association with the Minecraft brand, potentially confusing consumers who may believe this project is affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft.

Screenshots and Visual Similarity: The repository contains screenshots displaying in-game visuals that resemble Minecraft’s distinctive aesthetic, including the game world structure, block textures, and game interface elements unique to Minecraft.

Direct Reference to Minecraft Development and Modification: The README explicitly states that OpenCraft was created because Minecraft is closed-source, and it promotes OpenCraft as an alternative for “modifications” and distribution. This encourages users to bypass restrictions Microsoft places on Minecraft’s distribution and modification.Craft was created because Minecraft is closed-source, and it promotes OpenCraft as an alternative for “modifications” and distribution.

The content in this repository undermines the Minecraft brand by creating a nearly identical experience, potentially misleading users into believing that OpenCraft is authorized or endorsed by Microsoft when it is not. This unauthorized reproduction dilutes Minecraft’s unique value, impacts its goodwill, and creates consumer confusion. It further undermines Microsoft’s control over the Minecraft brand, development, and the marketplace.

Action Requested  
Given these facts, we request that GitHub immediately disable or remove access to the repository at https://github.com/OpenCraft-Studios/OpenCraft due to its infringement of Microsoft’s intellectual property rights. This repository is not licensed, authorized, or affiliated with Microsoft in any way. We are submitting this request in good faith and under penalty of perjury, asserting that the information provided is accurate and that we are authorized to act on behalf of Microsoft Corporation as the copyright owner of Minecraft.

Please confirm the action taken in response to this notice within seven (7) days.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
