We, Perfect World Games, have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
 
We noticed that there are two infringing links on GitHub showing the code of Perfect World Game’s software. The game “Perfect World International” was developed and published by Perfect World in 2015. Please refer to the official website: Global Official Website of Perfect World Games—Play Together. The software was recorded and published by NCAC and the number is 2009SR060911.
 
Infringing Links:  
1) https://github.com/SpinxDev/PWClient-152;

We are pretty sure that we have never authorized the third party to disclose the code in any public way.
 
Please understand that we do not have the contact information of the infringer, so we directly choose to send an e-mail to your party. Our appeal is that the infringing links should be deleted as soon as possible to avoid further damage.

We have taken fair use into consideration. And we swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that We are the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
