Dear Github DMCA team, 


GroupSense and Lenovo have discovered a Github repository containing proprietary code which is being illegally distributed. 


The repository is here - https://github.com/CHITTIMOTU/Lenovo-U1-Tool


The infringer’s contact information and profile page is here - https://github.com/CHITTIMOTU. 


The code contained in this repository is proprietary code owned by Lenovo (not to be made available for public consumption) and was leaked on GitHub. I hereby ask for the entire repository and all 6 associated forks to be removed from your site. 


I have read and understand Github’s guidelines for making a DMCA Takedown request. I attest that I am making this request as an authorized agent of Lenovo, with their explicit permission, in response to their request. 


I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.



I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I will be happy to answer any further questions or concerns.
